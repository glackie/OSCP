#### grep / strings

`grep` is made to pull strings of a given pattern out of a file (which I can treat the raw device as). I’ll call with the following arguments:

-   `-a` - Process a binary file as if it were text
-   `-P` - Interpret PATTERN as a Perl regular expression
-   `-o` - Print only the matched (non-empty) parts of a matching line, with each such part on a separate output line.

I’ll give it the pattern `[a-fA-F0-9]{32}`, which should find a 32-character hex string. It works:

```
root@raspberrypi:/# grep -aPo '[a-fA-F0-9]{32}' /dev/sdb
