great substitute for gobuster and ffuf


syntax - 


feroxbuster -u <target> -w <wordlist> -f -n

can also be used without the -f, -w, -n 
but good practice i would say

example:


â”Œâ”€â”€(rootðŸ’€kali)-[~/Desktop/THM/shocker]
â””â”€# feroxbuster -u http://10.10.10.56 -f -n


here -f will add a / after the word in wordlist because this is sometimes missed by other tools
also observed this when solving shocker htb machine


-x for extensions

â”€â”€(rootðŸ’€kali)-[~/Desktop/THM/shocker]
â””â”€# feroxbuster -u http://10.10.10.56/cgi-bin/ -x .sh,.py
