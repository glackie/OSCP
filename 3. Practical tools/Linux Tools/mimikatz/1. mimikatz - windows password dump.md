-   When we start Mimikatz we usually have to execute two commands before we start dumping hashes:

-  `privilege::debug` -- this obtains debug privileges which (without going into too much depth in the Windows privilege structure) allows us to access other processes for "debugging" purposes.
- `token::elevate` -- simply put, this takes us from our administrative shell with high privileges into a `SYSTEM` level shell with maximum privileges. This is something that we have a _right_ to do as an administrator, but that is not usually possible using normal Windows operations.
- With these commands executed, we are ready to dump some passwords hashes!

  
- There are a variety of commands we _could_ use here, all of which do slightly different things. The command that we _will_ use is: `lsadump::sam`.

- When executed, this will provide us with a list of password hashes for every account on the machine (with some extra information thrown in as well). The Administrator account password hash should be fairly near the top of the list:
