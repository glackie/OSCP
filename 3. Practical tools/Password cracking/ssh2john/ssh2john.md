Here i used ssh2john because i was asked to  give the passphrase for id_rsa file

â”Œâ”€â”€(rootðŸ’€kali)-[~/Desktop/THM]
â””â”€# ssh -i id_rsa kay@10.10.220.173 
Enter passphrase for key 'id_rsa': 

which obviously i didnt knew

so i followed a machine writeup which used ssh2john and steps are below


â”Œâ”€â”€(rootðŸ’€kali)-[~/Desktop/THM]
â””â”€# ssh2john id_rsa > forjohn2.txt



Followed with

â”€â”€(rootðŸ’€kali)-[~/Desktop/THM]
â””â”€# john forjohn2.txt --wordlist=/usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt   


â”Œâ”€â”€(rootðŸ’€kali)-[~/Desktop/THM]
â””â”€# ssh -i id_rsa kay@10.10.220.173 
Enter passphrase for key 'id_rsa':
