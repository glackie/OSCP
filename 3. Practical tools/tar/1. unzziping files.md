## Extracting tar.gz File

Gzip algorithm is designed to compress only a single file. Files that end in **.tar.gz** are **.tar** archives compressed with gzip.

To [extract a tar.gz file](https://linuxize.com/post/how-to-extract-unzip-tar-gz-file/) , use `tar` command with the `-xf` options followed by the compressed archive name:

```
tar -xf archive.tar.gz 
```


if you get an error the output file should not be mentioned
