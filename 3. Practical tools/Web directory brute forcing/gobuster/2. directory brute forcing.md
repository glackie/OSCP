brute forcing drectory syntax

```
gobuster dir -u https://example.com -w ~/wordlists/shortlist.txt
```


also checking -extensions
-x

â”€â”€(rootðŸ’€kali)-[~]
â””â”€# gobuster dir -u https://10.10.10.7/ -w /usr/share/wordlists/seclists/Discovery/Web-Content/directory-list-2.3-medium.txt -x .php -k





Additional thing learned here is 
if target is on ssl

we can skip the tls validation by add


-k 


as show above
