## Vhosts vs. Sub-domains

The key difference between VHosts and sub-domains is that a VHost is basically a 'sub-domain' served on the same server and has the same IP, such that a single IP could be serving two or more different websites.

`VHosts may or may not have public DNS records.`

In many cases, many websites would actually have sub-domains that are not public and will not publish them in public DNS records, and hence if we visit them in a browser, we would fail to connect, as the public DNS would not know their IP. 

Once again, if we use the `sub-domain fuzzing`, we would only be able to identify public sub-domains but will not identify any sub-domains that are not public.

This is where we utilize `VHosts Fuzzing` on an IP we already have. 

We will run a scan and test for scans on the same IP, and then we will be able to identify both public and non-public sub-domains and VHosts.

## Vhosts Fuzzing

To scan for VHosts, without manually adding the entire wordlist to our `/etc/hosts`, we will be fuzzing HTTP headers, specifically the `Host:` header.

To do that, we can use the `-H` flag to specify a header and will use the `FUZZ` keyword within it, as follows:

```shell-session
lack@htb[/htb]$ ffuf -w /opt/useful/SecLists/Discovery/DNS/subdomains-top1million-5000.txt:FUZZ -u http://academy.htb:PORT/ -H 'Host: FUZZ.academy.htb'
```

We see that all words in the wordlist are returning `200 OK`! 

This is expected, as we are simply changing the header while visiting `http://academy.htb:PORT/`. 

So, we know that we will always get `200 OK`. 

However, if the VHost does exist and we send a correct one in the header, we should get a different response size, as in that case, we would be getting the page from that VHosts, which is likely to show a different page.
