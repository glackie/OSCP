if i want to find a file with text password in it

>findstr /s /i password .txt         

we can also add other files types such as

**.ini *.conf

Other examples like

>cd C:\ & findstr /SI /M "password" *.xml *.ini *.txt


>findstr /si password *.xml *.ini *.txt *.config 2>nul >> results.txt



>findstr /spin "password" *.*
