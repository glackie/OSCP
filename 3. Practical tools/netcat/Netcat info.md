Netcat,82 first released in 1995(!) by *Hobbit* is one of the “original” network penetration testing tools and is so versatile that it lives up to the author’s designation as a hacker’s “Swiss army knife”. 

The clearest definition of Netcat is from *Hobbit* himself: a simple “utility which reads and writes data across network connections, using TCP or UDP protocols."
