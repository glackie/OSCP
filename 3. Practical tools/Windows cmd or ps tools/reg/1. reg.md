Performs operations on registry subkey information and values in registry entries.

Some operations enable you to view or configure registry entries on local or remote computers, while others allow you to configure only local computers. 

Using **reg** to configure the registry of remote computers limits the parameters that you can use in some operations.

Check the syntax and parameters for each operation to verify that they can be used on remote computers.
