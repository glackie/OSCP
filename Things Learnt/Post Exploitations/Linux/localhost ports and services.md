- there maybe some web services running locally on target machine , we can only see these after initial foothold

 we can list those using
```
ss -tulwn

```

post that we can use port forwarding to view the webpage in our local machine

using socat

```
./socat tcp-l:8080,fork,reuseaddr tcp:127.0.0.1:8111 &
```

need more info on this

we can also use [[SSH - port forwarding]]
