1. Once we are able to access the /etc/shadow or /etc/sudoers

We can add contents such as `

````
root    ALL=(ALL:ALL) ALL
````

or 

```
nicholsonjf    ALL=NOPASSWD: ALL
```

2. /etc/shadow

An x character indicates that encrypted password is stored in /etc/shadow file. So if u edit the x character, system will ignore the hash in /etc/shadow and use your password as password.

Need to study more on this
