File signatures, commonly referred to as "magic bytes", are specific byte sequences at the beginning of a file that identify or verify its content type and format. These bytes often have corresponding ASCII characters, allowing for easier human readability when inspected. The identification process helps software applications quickly determine whether a file is in a format they can handle, aiding operational functionality and security measures.

In cyber security, file signatures are crucial for identifying file types and formats. You'll encounter them in malware analysis, incident response, network traffic inspection, web security checks, and forensics. Knowing how to work with these magic bytes can help you quickly identify malicious or suspicious activity and choose the right tools for deeper analysis.

Here is a list of some of the most common files and their magic:

|   |   |   |
|---|---|---|
|File Format|Magic Bytes|ASCII representation|
|PNG image file|89 50 4E 47 0D 0A 1A 0A|%PNG|
|GIF image file|47 49 46 38|GIF8|
|Windows and DOS executables|4D 5A|MZ|
|Linux ELF executables|7F 45 4C 46|.ELF|
|MP3 audio file|49 44 33|


These magic bytes are an immediate identifier to any program or system trying to read the file, signalling that it's a Windows or DOS executable. A lot of programs rely on these bytes to quickly decide whether the file is of a type they can handle, which is crucial for operational functionality and security. If these bytes are incorrect or mismatched, it could lead to errors, data corruption, or potential security risks.
