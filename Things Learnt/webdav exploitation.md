A **HTTP Server with WebDav** active is a server where you probably can **update, delete, move, copy** files. **Sometimes** you **need** to have **valid credentials** (usually check with HTTP Basic Authentication).

You should try to **upload** some **webshell** and **execute** it from the web server to take control over the server. Usually, to **connect** a WebDav server you will need valid **credentials**: [**WebDav bruteforce**](/generic-methodologies-and-resources/brute-force#http-basic-auth) _(Basic Auth)_.

Other common configuration is to **forbid uploading** files with **extensions** that will be **executed** by the web server, you should check how to **bypass this:**

- **Upload** files with **executable extensions** (maybe it's not forbidden).
    

- **Upload** files **without executable extensions** (like .txt) and try to **rename** the file (move) with an **executable extension**.
    

- **Upload** files **without executable extensions** (like .txt) and try to **copy** the file (move) with **executable extension.**
