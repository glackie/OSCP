Found a login Page at

http://10.10.212.50/wp-login.php

However default creds were not working and got dictionary was too big for brute force attack using burp suite

Got stuck here and went for the writeup 


Got to know that username we had to was "elliot"


And I also figured out my wpscan error and used below command to get valid credentials

```
wpscan --url http://10.10.212.50/wp-login.php -P ufsociety.list --usernames elliot
```

after getting the credentails I read and tried multiple writeups, i tried multiple exploitations


Upload a php reverse shell in upload  plugin failed

and had to use another writeup for detailed walkthrough
