Used previously mentioned resource for getting a shell

Changed the content of a 404.php file

Generated an error to view the 404 page and trigger the exploit

	Started a netcat listener before this

And i got a shell as deamon user

```$ whoami
daemon
```


Gettting shell as robot

in the /home directory of robot we find a file named

password.raw-md5


I cracked the hash inside the file using

```
hashcat -m 0 robot.hash -a 0 /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt 
```
