since only one port is open this must be some WAPT type attack

on the webpage it stated it was running fuel cms

v1.4


i checked online for vuln and there was an RCE but i was not able to find any portal and went for writeup


but turns out i was stupin and didnt fully ready the index page


there was a web link with credentials

To access the FUEL admin, go to:  
[http://10.10.124.55/fuel](http://10.10.124.55/fuel)  
User name: **admin**  
Password: **admin** (you can and should change this password and admin user information after logging in)


after logging in i got here

http://10.10.124.55/fuel/dashboard


fo from here i can do pretty much anything but i noticed a upload option in 

http://10.10.230.180/fuel/pages/upload?inline=

but i was denied saying filetype was not allowed for .php5 so 

intercetped in burp and used dictionary of extension 

tried all but not luck but i found out iw as able to upload .php file here
http://10.10.230.180/fuel/navigation/upload


so i got stuck here and went for the writeup
