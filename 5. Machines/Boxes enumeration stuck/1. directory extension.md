after bruteforcing with ffuf and not finding any useful URLs

we use bruteforce exttension to see what is running (we can also use wappalyzer)

in the wappalyzer i saw a server was running PHP


	Usually if server is apache then extension would be .php

	usually if server is IIS then extension would be .asp or .aspx


so i bruteforce the webdirectory using ffuf and used below command

â”Œâ”€â”€(rootðŸ’€kali)-[~]
â””â”€# ffuf -w /usr/share/wordlists/seclists/Discovery/Web-Content/directory-list-2.3-small.txt:FUZZ -u http://10.10.129.220/FUZZ.php


and boom i got 2 directories - /login.php

-/portal.php
