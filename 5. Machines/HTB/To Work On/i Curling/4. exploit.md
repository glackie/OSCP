so here i took some hint from the writeup


saw that we can put some code in the tempaltes

learned how to check for RCE with a php code


[[PHP code to check RCE]]


used that to create a new file in tempaltes


used this resource to locate hte uploaded php file
https://docs.joomla.org/Understanding_Joomla!_templates



created a file - used above technique - to check for code execution and got it




created a php reverse shell command using shellgen

â”Œâ”€â”€(rootðŸ’€kali)-[~/Desktop/THM]
â””â”€# ./shellgen tun0 9001  



Then used it to get a reverse shell as www-data



but I had to get floris user to get user flag



so basically followed the entire writeup from there since i am stupid



Also learnt how to deal with [[8. Hexa Dumps]]
We can also use [[CyberChef]] to deal with this

adn we get a password.txt file in the dump with this we can ssh into the machine as floris




stopped after getting a user flag since root seemd defificult for now and i wanted to learn more
