here checked for 

sudo -l

SUID bits

but nothing usefull


but we get 3 cronjobs


ruby@precious:/home$ cat /etc/crontab

with some details


ruby@precious:/home$ ls -al /etc | grep cron

so i got stuck here and went with writeup


messup up  with enumeration here

there was a .bundle file with henry user credentails

BUNDLE_HTTPS://RUBYGEMS__ORG/: "henry:Q3c1AqGHtoI0aXAYFH"



ssh into the machine with henry


Now

henry@precious:/tmp$ sudo -l

we can this as sudo

(root) NOPASSWD: /usr/bin/ruby /opt/update_dependencies.rb


but we dont have write permission to it

-rwxr-xr-x  1 root root  848 Sep 25 11:02 update_dependencies.rb


and also when i try to run this file as sudo it is not working
Okay it is working when I mention the full path

took a hint from the writeup -

YAML.load

still not working so followed the steps in writeup


Writeup :https://0xdedinfosec.vercel.app/blog/hackthebox-precious-writeup

Malicious yaml code: https://gist.github.com/staaldraad/89dffe369e1454eedd3306edc8a7e565#file-ruby_yaml_load_sploit2-yaml


created a file called dependecnies.yml on henry home directory

when ruinning the sudo command we get an error but at the start of that error 

         method_id: :resolve
henry@precious:~$ sudo /usr/bin/ruby /opt/update_dependencies.rb
sh: 1: reading: not found
uid=0(root) gid=0(root) groups=0(root)


this probably means that command was succcessfully run as root and gave the output this means we have arbitary code execution
