tried to ssh into the machine with the rsa key and usernmae:valentine but not working


so


got a hint from the writeup that this is regarding heartbleed vuln


https://stackabuse.com/how-to-exploit-the-heartbleed-bug/

this resource helped to check if target is vuln or not


â”€â”€(rootðŸ’€kali)-[~/Desktop/THM/valentine]
â””â”€# python2 heartbleet.py 10.10.10.79 -p 443




and continued with writeup


https://0xdf.gitlab.io/2018/07/28/htb-valentine.html#running-exploit



just followed the writeup to get the user flag


	 


got stuck here as was getting ssh error and was not able to login as hype
