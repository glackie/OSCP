so here after loggin in as scriptmanager i search for standard stuff
b

but one thing that stands out was the modbash binary in /tmp


didnt find anything out it on gtfo bins as well


so i can confirm this was the vector i had to use but didnt know what to do with it


so went with the writeup


turns out i was wrong and forgot to reset the machine
realized it by resetting the machine



now going into

/scripts


so again i wasted another 3-4 hrous of my life getting stuck here


Followed the write but still was not able to get the root shell so will try again later
