Tring some exploits mentioned in 

â”Œâ”€â”€(rootðŸ’€kali)-[~/Desktop/THM/beep]
â””â”€# searchsploit elastix  


1st one is

FreePBX 2.10.0 / Elastix 2.2.0 - Remote Code Execution    | php/webapps/18650.py

Now followed the steps in writeup bu made some fine tuning and i got it in the end


but same problem when adding burp as listener and redirecting the request to target machine


hand to make some changes in settings but later worked it out


now as per the writeup we get en erorr and no reverse shell in the nc listener


Now we are introduced to a new tool


https://github.com/EnableSecurity/sipvicious



we get it and go through it to see what it does


so basically we are checking if we can changed the extension paramter to see if we find any other vlaid extension line details to get a revers shell since we now know the it is working we just have to resolve the error




now following the writeup


git clone https://github.com/EnableSecurity/sipvicious


checking how to use the tool

https://github.com/EnableSecurity/sipvicious/wiki/SVWar-Usage



basic syntax 

```
Usage: ./svwar [options] target
examples:
./svwar -e100-999 10.0.0.1
./svwar -d dictionary.txt udp://10.0.0.2:5080
```


using this command as per writeup

got an error in with python but no luck so used the write to see we had to change the extention to 233 and we get a shell in out nc listener



Hwere i also learn to make the shell completly interactive
added notes to it: 
[[How to get interactive bash shell - must be run from a terminal]]


escalating priv with the user was pretty easy with gtfo bins
