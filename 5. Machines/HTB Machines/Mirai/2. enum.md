default creds for this user dashboard login is 

pi
raspberry


not working in dashbaord login



However these creds worked to login for ssh


we have a foothold


sudo -l shows we can run all commands so


got root access with 
sudo su



find the root.txt was a challange and i failed in it so
followed the writeup and also learnt new things abt grep
