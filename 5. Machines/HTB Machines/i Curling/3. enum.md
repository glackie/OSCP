after getting a hint to use the cewl wordlist



created a cewl wordlist using:


â”€â”€(rootðŸ’€kali)-[~]
â””â”€# cewl http://10.10.10.150/



also in the source code at the end there was something written as secret.txt


so 


http://10.10.10.150/secret.txt

	Q3VybGluZzIwMTgh




assuming this is the password and list of users we get from cewl we can maybe do a bruteforce with burp 

so iw as an idiot here 


the /secret.txt was a base64 easy ecode and but i was instead trying to crack it as hash and using it as password




so we were able to login into 

/administrator with floris

and 


â”€â”€(rootðŸ’€kali)-[~]
â””â”€# echo "Q3VybGluZzIwMTgh" | base64 -d                                                 1 â¨¯
Curling2018!



sadly they are not working for ssh into machine with floris user



just went through the writeup and this is definetly medium level shit because most of the stuff is new and not what i expected. Will continue the exploit till root.txt tomorrow
