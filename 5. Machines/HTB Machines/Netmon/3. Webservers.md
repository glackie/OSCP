We see there is a login portal on the webserver


tried ffuf but notihing usefull

checked for default credentials but not working



Now - We see the webserver is running an application PRTG network monitor, since all apps are installed on C drive

we have to find config files for this app-
I searched "how and where PRTG network monitor stores data"


found a path: C:/ProgramData/Paessler\PRTG Network Monitor



I this path we can see multiple files


we found a set of credentials in 

PRTG Configuration.old.bak

usename: prtgadmin
password: PrTg@dmin2018


These are not working because 

PRTG Configuration.old.bak - this was created in 2018

PRTG Configuration.old - this was created in 2019

considering they change the passwrod every year with dates



usename: prtgadmin
password: PrTg@dmin2019

These worked
