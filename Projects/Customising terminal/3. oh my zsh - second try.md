Default settings are 

```
Quick commands:

Remember that the default `<prefix>` is `ctrl+b`.

- Split panes by pressing `<prefix> + %` and `<prefix> + "`.
- Kill panes by pressing `<prefix> + x`.
- Switch panes with `<prefix> + arrow`.
- Create new windows by pressing `<prefix> + c`.
- Switch windows by pressing `<prefix> + number`.
- Rename windows with `<prefix> + ,`
- Zoom in and out a pane with `<prefix> + z`
- Detach with `<prefix> + d` and reattach with `tmux`.
```

- changed my theme to 
```
ZSH_THEME="powerlevel10k/powerlevel10k"

```

- i can now split the terminal

```
ctrl + b + shift + % - vertical

ctrl + b + shift + " - horizontal

alt + <arrow keys> - for navigating trhrough shell

ctrl + b + <arrow keys> or ctr + <arrow keys>  

                 - for resizing the split shell
```
