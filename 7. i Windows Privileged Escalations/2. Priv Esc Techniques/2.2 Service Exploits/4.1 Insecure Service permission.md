Each service has an ACL which defines certain service-specific permissions.

Some permissions are innocuous (e.g. SERVICE_QUERY_CONFIG,
SERVICE_QUERY_STATUS).

Some may be useful (e.g. SERVICE_STOP, SERVICE_START).

Some are dangerous (e.g. SERVICE_CHANGE_CONFIG,
SERVICE_ALL_ACCESS)

If our user has permission to change the configuration of a service which runs with SYSTEM privileges, we can change the executable, the service uses to one of our own.

>Potential Rabbit Hole: If you can change a service
configuration but cannot stop/start the service, you may not be able to escalate privileges!
