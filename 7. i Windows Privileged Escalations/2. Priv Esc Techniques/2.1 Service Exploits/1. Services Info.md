Services are simply programs that run in the
background, accepting input or performing regular
tasks.

If services run with SYSTEM privileges and are
misconfigured, exploiting them may lead to command
execution with SYSTEM privileges as well.


Service Misconfigurations
1. Insecure Service Properties
2. Unquoted Service Path
3. Weak Registry Permissions
4. Insecure Service Executables
5. DLL Hijacking
