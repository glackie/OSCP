The SUID bit set for the nano text editor allows us to create, edit and read files using the file ownerâ€™s privilege. Nano is owned by root, which probably means that we can read and edit files at a higher privilege level than our current user has. At this stage, we have two basic options for privilege escalation: reading the `/etc/shadow` file or adding our user to `/etc/passwd`.



We see that the nano text editor has the SUID bit set by running the `find / -type f -perm -04000 -ls 2>/dev/null` command.


  
`nano /etc/shadow` will print the contents of the `/etc/shadow` file.


We can now use the unshadow tool to create a file crackable by John the Ripper. To achieve this, unshadow needs both the `/etc/shadow` and `/etc/passwd` files.


in this example I was able to use base64 commands with SUID bit set


filename was flag3.txt

I was not able to access
 this file with my current user privileges but when i run the command


>base64 flag3.txt | base64 -d


I was able to see the contents of flag3.txt without root privileges
