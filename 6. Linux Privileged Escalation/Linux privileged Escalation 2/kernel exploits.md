The kernel on Linux systems manages the communication between components such as the memory on the system and applications. 

This critical function requires the kernel to have specific privileges; thus, a successful exploit will potentially lead to root privileges.

The Kernel exploit methodology is simple;

1.  Identify the kernel version
2.  Search and find an exploit code for the kernel version of the target system
3.  Run the exploit

	Note - Although it looks simple, please remember that a failed kernel exploit can lead to a system crash. Make sure this potential outcome is acceptable within the scope of your penetration testing engagement before attempting a kernel exploit.


Now to performed kernel exploit

	use 
	priv esc - enumeration - automated tools 2 

	here you can follow how to get exploit into that tharget system and run it

	simple as that
