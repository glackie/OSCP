JavaScript is a scripting or programming language that allows you to implement complex features on web pages. Like with other programming languages, we can use it for many different things.

The following JavaScript code is based on [this](https://superuser.com/questions/25538/how-to-download-files-from-command-line-in-windows-like-wget-or-curl/373068) post, and we can download a file using it. We'll create a file called `wget.js` and save the following content:

Code: javascript

```javascript
var WinHttpReq = new ActiveXObject("WinHttp.WinHttpRequest.5.1");
WinHttpReq.Open("GET", WScript.Arguments(0), /*async=*/false);
WinHttpReq.Send();
BinStream = new ActiveXObject("ADODB.Stream");
BinStream.Type = 1;
BinStream.Open();
BinStream.Write(WinHttpReq.ResponseBody);
BinStream.SaveToFile(WScript.Arguments(1));
```

We can use the following command from a Windows command prompt or PowerShell terminal to execute our JavaScript code and download a file.
