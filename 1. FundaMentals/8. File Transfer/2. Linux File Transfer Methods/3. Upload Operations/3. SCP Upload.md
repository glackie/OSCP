#### File Upload using SCP

File Upload using SCP

```shell-session
glack@htb[/htb]$ scp /etc/passwd plaintext@192.168.49.128:/home/plaintext/

plaintext@192.168.49.128's password: 
passwd                                                                                                           100% 3414     6.7MB/s   00:00
```

**Note:** Remember that scp syntax is similar to cp or copy.
