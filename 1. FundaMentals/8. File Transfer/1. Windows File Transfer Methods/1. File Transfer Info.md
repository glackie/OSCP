The Windows operating system has evolved over the past few years, and new versions come with different utilities for file transfer operations. Understanding file transfer in Windows can help both attackers and defenders. Attackers can use various file transfer methods to operate and avoid being caught. Defenders can learn how these methods work to monitor and create the corresponding policies to avoid being compromised. Let's use the [Microsoft Astaroth Attack](https://www.microsoft.com/security/blog/2019/07/08/dismantling-a-fileless-campaign-microsoft-defender-atp-next-gen-protection-exposes-astaroth-attack/) blog post as an example of an advanced persistent threat (APT).

The blog post starts out talking about [fileless threats](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/security/intelligence/fileless-threats?view=o365-worldwide). The term `fileless` suggests that a threat doesn't come in a file, they use legitimate tools built into a system to execute an attack. This doesn't mean that there's not a file transfer operation. As discussed later in this section, the file is not "present" on the system but runs in memory.

The `Astaroth attack` generally followed these steps: A malicious link in a spear-phishing email led to an LNK file. When double-clicked, the LNK file caused the execution of the [WMIC tool](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/wmisdk/wmic) with the "/Format" parameter, which allowed the download and execution of malicious JavaScript code. The JavaScript code, in turn, downloads payloads by abusing the [Bitsadmin tool](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/bits/bitsadmin-tool).

All the payloads were base64-encoded and decoded using the Certutil tool resulting in a few DLL files. The [regsvr32](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/administration/windows-commands/regsvr32) tool was then used to load one of the decoded DLLs, which decrypted and loaded other files until the final payload, Astaroth, was injected into the `Userinit` process. Below is a graphical depiction of the attack.

This is an excellent example of multiple methods for file transfer and the threat actor using those methods to bypass defenses.

This section will discuss using some native Windows tools for download and upload operations. Later in the module, we'll discuss `Living Off The Land` binaries on Windows & Linux and how to use them to perform file transfer operations.
