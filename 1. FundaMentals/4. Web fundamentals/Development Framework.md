In addition to web servers that can host web applications in various languages, there are many common web development frameworks that help in developing core web application files and functionality. 

With the increased complexity of web applications, it may be challenging to create a modern and sophisticated web application from scratch. Hence, most of the popular web applications are developed using web frameworks.

As most web applications share common functionality -such as user registration-, web development frameworks make it easy to quickly implement this functionality and link them to the front end components, making a fully functional web application. Some of the most common web development frameworks include:

-   [Laravel](https://laravel.com/) (`PHP`): usually used by startups and smaller companies, as it is powerful yet easy to develop for.
-   [Express](https://expressjs.com/) (`Node.JS`): used by `PayPal`, `Yahoo`, `Uber`, `IBM`, and `MySpace`.
-   [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/) (`Python`): used by `Google`, `YouTube`, `Instagram`, `Mozilla`, and `Pinterest`.
-   [Rails](https://rubyonrails.org) (`Ruby`): used by `GitHub`, `Hulu`, `Twitch`, `Airbnb`, and even `Twitter` in the past.

It must be noted that popular websites usually utilize a variety of frameworks and web servers, rather than just one.
