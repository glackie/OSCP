## Special Variables

Special variables use the [Internal Field Separator](https://bash.cyberciti.biz/guide/$IFS) (`IFS`) to identify when an argument ends and the next begins. 

Bash provides various special variables that assist while scripting. Some of these variables are:

|**IFS**|**Description**|
|---|---|
|`$#`|This variable holds the number of arguments passed to the script.|
|`$@`|This variable can be used to retrieve the list of command-line arguments.|
|`$n`|Each command-line argument can be selectively retrieved using its position. For example, the first argument is found at `$1`.|
|`$$`|The process ID of the currently executing process.|
|`$?`|The exit status of the script. This variable is useful to determine a command's success. The value 0 represents successful execution, while 1 is a result of a failure.|

Of the ones shown above, we have 3 such special variables in our `if-else` condition.

|**IFS**|**Description**|
|---|---|
|`$#`|In this case, we need just one variable that needs to be assigned to the `domain` variable. This variable is used to specify the target we want to work with. If we provide just an FQDN as the argument, the `$#` variable will have a value of `1`.|
|`$0`|This special variable is assigned the name of the executed script, which is then shown in the "`Usage:`" example.|
|`$1`|Separated by a space, the first argument is assigned to that special variable.|
