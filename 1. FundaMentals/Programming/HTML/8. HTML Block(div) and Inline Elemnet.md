Every HTML element has a default display value, depending on what type of element it is.

There are two display values: block and inline.


## Block-level Elements

A block-level element always starts on a new line, and the browsers automatically add some space (a margin) before and after the element.

A block-level element always takes up the full width available (stretches out to the left and right as far as it can).

Two commonly used block elements are: `<p>` and `<div>`.

The `<p>` element defines a paragraph in an HTML document.

The `<div>` element defines a division or a section in an HTML document.

The `< p >` element is a block-level element.

The `< div >` element is a block-level element.


## Inline Elements

An inline element does not start on a new line.

An inline element only takes up as much width as necessary.

This is a `< span >` element inside a paragraph.

```
<span>Hello World</span>
```
