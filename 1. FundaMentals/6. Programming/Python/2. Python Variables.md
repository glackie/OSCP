### Creating Variables

- Python has no command for declaring a variable.

- A variable is created the moment you first assign a value to it.

```python
x = 5  
y = "John"  
print(x)  
print(y)

x = 4       # x is of type int  
x = "Sally" # x is now of type str  
print(x)


#If you want to specify the data type of a variable, this can be done with casting.
x = str(3)    # x will be '3'  
y = int(3)    # y will be 3  
z = float(3)  # z will be 3.0


#You can get the data type of a variable with the `type()` function.
x = 5  
y = "John"  
print(type(x))  
print(type(y))


#String variables can be declared either by using single or double quotes:
x = "John"  
# is the same as  
x = 'John'


#Variable names are case-sensitive.
a = 4  
A = "Sally"  
#A will not overwrite a


#Python allows you to assign values to multiple variables in one line:
x, y, z = "Orange", "Banana", "Cherry"  
print(x)  
print(y)  
print(z)


#And you can assign the _same_ value to multiple variables in one line:
x = y = z = "Orange"  
print(x)  
print(y)  
print(z)
```

- The Python `print()` function is often used to output variables.

```

x = "Python is awesome"  
print(x)
```

The names you use when creating these labels need to follow a few rules:

  

1. Names can not start with a number.

2. There can be no spaces in the name, use _ instead.

3. Can't use any of these symbols :'",<>/?|\()!@#$%^&*~-+

4. It's considered best practice (PEP8) that names are lowercase.

5. Avoid using the characters 'l' (lowercase letter el), 'O' (uppercase letter oh),

or 'I' (uppercase letter eye) as single character variable names.

6. Avoid using words that have special meaning in Python like "list" and "str"

  
  

Using variable names can be a very useful way to keep track of different variables in Python. For example:
