### Syntax

```python
    while test:
        code statements
    else:
        final code statements
```

examples:

```python
x = 0

while x < 10:
    print('x is currently: ',x)
    print(' x is still less than 10, adding 1 to x')
    x+=1
    
else:
    print('All Done!')
```

# break, continue, pass

We can use <code>break</code>, <code>continue</code>, and <code>pass</code> statements in our loops to add additional functionality for various cases. The three statements are defined by:

    break: Breaks out of the current closest enclosing loop.
    continue: Goes to the top of the closest enclosing loop.
    pass: Does nothing at all.
    
    
Thinking about <code>break</code> and <code>continue</code> statements, the general format of the <code>while</code> loop looks like this:

```python
    while test: 
        code statement
        if test: 
            break
        if test: 
            continue 
    else:
```

<code>break</code> and <code>continue</code> statements can appear anywhere inside the loopâ€™s body, but we will usually put them further nested in conjunction with an <code>if</code> statement to perform an action based on some condition.

Let's go ahead and look at some examples!

```python
x = 0

while x < 10:
    print('x is currently: ',x)
    print(' x is still less than 10, adding 1 to x')
    x+=1
    if x==3:
        print('Breaking because x==3')
        break
    else:
        print('continuing...')
        continue
```
