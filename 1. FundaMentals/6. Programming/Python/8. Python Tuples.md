1.) Constructing Tuples

```python
# Create a tuple

t = (1,2,3)
```

2.) Basic Tuple Methods

```python
# Check len just like a list

len(t)

# Use indexing just like we did in lists
t[0]


# Use .index to enter a value and return the index
t.index('one')

# Use .count to count the number of times a value appears
t.count('one')

```


3.) Immutability

It can't be stressed enough that tuples are immutable.


4.) When to Use Tuples

tuples are not used as often as lists in programming, but are used when immutability is necessary. If in your program you are passing around an object and need to make sure it does not get changed, then a tuple becomes your solution. It provides a convenient source of data integrity.
