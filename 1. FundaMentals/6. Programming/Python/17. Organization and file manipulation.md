# Permanently Deleting Files and Folders

# You can delete a single file or a single empty folder with functions in the

# os module, whereas to delete a folder and all of its contents, you use the

# shutil module.

  

# Calling os.unlink(path) will delete the file at path.

# Calling os.rmdir(path) will delete the folder at path. This folder must be empty of any files or folders.

# Calling shutil.rmtree(path) will remove the folder at path, and all files and folders it contains will also be deleted.

  

# os.unlink(pathboi / "accounts_copy.txt") # deleting the file - commenting out to avoid cluttering the terminal

# Walking a Directory Tree

  

# os.walk() function is passed a single string value: the path of a folder.

# You can use os.walk() in a for loop statement to walk a directory tree, much like how you can use the range() function to walk over a range of numbers.
