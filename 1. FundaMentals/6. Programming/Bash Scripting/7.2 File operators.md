## File Operators

The file operators are useful if we want to find out specific permissions or if they exist.

|**Operator**|**Description**|
|---|---|
|`-e`|if the file exist|
|`-f`|tests if it is a file|
|`-d`|tests if it is a directory|
|`-L`|tests if it is if a symbolic link|
|`-N`|checks if the file was modified after it was last read|
|`-O`|if the current user owns the file|
|`-G`|if the file’s group id matches the current user’s|
|`-s`|tests if the file has a size greater than 0|
|`-r`|tests if the file has read permission|
|`-w`|tests if the file has write permission|
|`-x`|tests if the file has execute permission|

Code: bash

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Check if the specified file exists
if [ -e "$1" ]
then
	echo -e "The file exists."
	exit 0

else
	echo -e "The file does not exist."
	exit 2
fi
```
