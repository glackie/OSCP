## PHP Conditional Statements

Very often when you write code, you want to perform different actions for different conditions. You can use conditional statements in your code to do this.

In PHP we have the following conditional statements:

- `if` statement - executes some code if one condition is true
- `if...else` statement - executes some code if a condition is true and another code if that condition is false
- `if...elseif...else` statement - executes different codes for more than two conditions
- `switch` statement - selects one of many blocks of code to be executed

## PHP - The if Statement

The `if` statement executes some code if one condition is true.

```php
<?php  
$t = date("H");  
  
if ($t < "20") {  
  echo "Have a good day!";  
}  
?>
```

## PHP - The if...else Statement

The `if...else` statement executes some code if a condition is true and another code if that condition is false.

```php
<?php  
$t = date("H");  
  
if ($t < "20") {  
  echo "Have a good day!";  
} else {  
  echo "Have a good night!";  
}  
?>
```

## PHP - The if...elseif...else Statement

The `if...elseif...else` statement executes different codes for more than two conditions.

```php
<?php  
$t = date("H");  
  
if ($t < "10") {  
  echo "Have a good morning!";  
} elseif ($t < "20") {  
  echo "Have a good day!";  
} else {  
  echo "Have a good night!";  
}  
?>
```

## The PHP switch Statement

Use the `switch` statement to **select one of many blocks of code to be executed**.

The `switch` statement is used to perform different actions based on different conditions.

```php
<?php  
$favcolor = "red";  
  
switch ($favcolor) {  
  case "red":  
    echo "Your favorite color is red!";  
    break;  
  case "blue":  
    echo "Your favorite color is blue!";  
    break;  
  case "green":  
    echo "Your favorite color is green!";  
    break;  
  default:  
    echo "Your favorite color is neither red, blue, nor green!";  
}  
?>
```
