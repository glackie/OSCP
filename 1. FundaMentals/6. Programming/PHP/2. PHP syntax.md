A PHP script is executed on the server, and the plain HTML result is sent back to the browser.

## Basic PHP Syntax

A PHP script can be placed anywhere in the document.

A PHP script starts with `<?php` and ends with `?>`:

```php
<?php  
// PHP code goes here  
?>
```

The default file extension for PHP files is "`.php`".

A PHP file normally contains HTML tags, and some PHP scripting code.

Below, we have an example of a simple PHP file, with a PHP script that uses a built-in PHP function "`echo`" to output the text "Hello World!" on a web page:

```php
<!DOCTYPE html>  
<html>  
<body>  
  
<h1>My first PHP page</h1>  
  
<?php  
echo "Hello World!";  
?>  
  
</body>  
</html>
```


## Comments in PHP

A comment in PHP code is a line that is not executed as a part of the program. Its only purpose is to be read by someone who is looking at the code.

```php
<!DOCTYPE html>  
<html>  
<body>  
  
<?php  
// This is a single-line comment  
  
# This is also a single-line comment  

/*  
This is a multiple-lines comment block  
that spans over multiple  
lines  
*/

// You can also use comments to leave out parts of a code line  
$x = 5 /* + 15 */ + 5;  
echo $x;

?>  
  
</body>  
</html>
```
