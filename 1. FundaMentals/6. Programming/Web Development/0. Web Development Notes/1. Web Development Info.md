## What About Back-End?

- Front-end development refers to the **client**-side (how a web page **looks**).  
- Back-end development refers to the **server**-side (how a web page **works**).

- Front-end code is used to create **static** websites, where the purpose is to display the web page. 
- However, if you want to make your website **dynamic** (manage files and databases, add contact forms, control user-access, etc.), you need to learn a back-end programming language, like [PHP](https://www.w3schools.com/php/default.asp "Go To Our PHP Tutorial") or [Python](https://www.w3schools.com/python/default.asp "Go To Our Python Tutorial"), and use [SQL](https://www.w3schools.com/sql/default.asp "Go To Our SQL Tutorial") to communicate with databases.
