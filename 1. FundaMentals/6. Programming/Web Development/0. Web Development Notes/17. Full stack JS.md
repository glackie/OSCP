## Full Stack JavaScript

- JavaScript has been around for over 20 years. It is the dominant programming language in web development.

- In the beginning JavaScript was a language for the web client (browser). Then came the ability to use JavaScript on the web server (with Node.js).

- Today the hottest buzzword is "Full Stack JavaScript".

- The idea of "Full Stack JavaScript" is that all software in a web application, both client side and server side, should be written using JavaScript only.
