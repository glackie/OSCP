- JSON stands for **J**ava**S**cript **O**bject **N**otation

- JSON is a lightweight format for storing and transporting data

- JSON is often used when data is sent from a server to a web page

- JSON is "self-describing" and easy to understand

### JSON Example

This example defines an employees object: an array of 3 employee records (objects):

```json
{  
"employees":[  
    {"firstName":"John", "lastName":"Doe"},  
    {"firstName":"Anna", "lastName":"Smith"},  
    {"firstName":"Peter", "lastName":"Jones"}  
]  
}
```

### JSON Syntax Rules

- Data is in name/value pairs
- Data is separated by commas
- Curly braces hold objects
- Square brackets hold arrays

---

### JavaScript Object Notation

- The JSON format is syntactically identical to the code for creating JavaScript objects.

- Because of this similarity, a JavaScript program can easily convert JSON data into native JavaScript object

    The JSON syntax is derived from JavaScript object notation syntax, but the JSON format is text only. Code for reading and generating JSON data can be written in any programming language.
