- When making responsive web pages, add the following `<meta>` element to all your web pages:
```html
<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
```

### Media Queries

- Media Queries plays an important role in responsive web pages.

- With media queries you can define different styles for different browser sizes.

Example:  
Resize the browser window to see that the three elements below will display horizontally on large screens and vertically on small screens:

```html
<style>  
.left, .right {  float: left;  
  width: 20%; /* The width is 20%, by default */}  
  
.main {  float: left;  
  width: 60%; /* The width is 60%, by default */}  
  
/* Use Media Query to add a breakpoint at 800px: */  
@media screen and (max-width:800px) {  .left , .main, .right {width:100%;}}  
</style>
```

### Responsive Images

- Responsive images are images that scale nicely to fit any browser size.

- When the CSS width property is set to a percentage value, an image will scale up and down when resizing the browser window.

- This image is responsive:
```html
<img src="img_girl.jpg" style="width:80%;height:auto;">
```

- If the `max-width` property is set to 100%, the image will scale down if it has to, but never scale up to be larger than its original size:
```html
<img src="img_girl.jpg" style="max-width:100%;height:auto;">
```
