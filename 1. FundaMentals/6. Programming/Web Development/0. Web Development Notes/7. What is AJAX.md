AJAX is a developer's dream, because you can:

- Read data from a web server - after a web page has loaded
- Update a web page without reloading the page
- Send data to a web server - in the background

### What is AJAX?

- AJAX = **A**synchronous **J**avaScript **A**nd **X**ML.

- AJAX is not a programming language.

- AJAX just uses a combination of:

    - A browser built-in XMLHttpRequest object (to request data from a web server)
    - JavaScript and HTML DOM (to display or use the data)

---

- AJAX is a misleading name. AJAX applications might use XML to transport data, but it is equally common to transport data as plain text or JSON text.

- AJAX allows web pages to be updated asynchronously by exchanging data with a web server behind the scenes. 

- This means that it is possible to update parts of a web page, without reloading the whole page.
