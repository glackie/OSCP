## Full-stack Web Developer

A full-stack web developer is a person who can develop both **client** and **server** software.

In addition to mastering HTML and CSS, he/she also knows how to:

- Program a **browser** (e.g. using JavaScript, jQuery, Angular, or Vue)
- Program a **server** (e.g. using PHP, ASP, Python, or Node)
- Program a **database** (e.g. using SQL, SQLite, or MongoDB)
