## What is an Array?

An array is a special variable, which can hold more than one value at a time.

If you have a list of items (a list of car names, for example), storing the cars in single variables could look like this:

```php
$cars1 = "Volvo";  
$cars2 = "BMW";  
$cars3 = "Toyota";
```


## Create an Array in PHP

In PHP, the `array()` function is used to create an array:

In PHP, there are three types of arrays:

- **Indexed arrays** - Arrays with a numeric index
- **Associative arrays** - Arrays with named keys
- **Multidimensional arrays** - Arrays containing one or more arrays

## Get The Length of an Array - The count() Function

The `count()` function is used to return the length (the number of elements) of an array:

```php
<?php  
$cars = array("Volvo", "BMW", "Toyota");  
echo count($cars);  
?>
```

## PHP Indexed Arrays

The index can be assigned automatically (index always starts at 0), like this:

```
$cars = array("Volvo", "BMW", "Toyota");
```

The following example creates an indexed array named $cars, assigns three elements to it, and then prints a text containing the array values:

```php
<?php  
$cars = array("Volvo", "BMW", "Toyota");  
echo "I like " . $cars[0] . ", " . $cars[1] . " and " . $cars[2] . ".";  
?>
```

### Loop Through an Indexed Array

```php
<?php  
$cars = array("Volvo", "BMW", "Toyota");  
$arrlength = count($cars);  
  
for($x = 0; $x < $arrlength; $x++) {  
  echo $cars[$x];  
  echo "<br>";  
}  
?>
```

## PHP Associative Arrays

Associative arrays are arrays that use named keys that you assign to them.

There are two ways to create an associative array: 

`$age = array("Peter"=>"35", "Ben"=>"37", "Joe"=>"43");`

or:

```php
$age['Peter'] = "35";  
$age['Ben'] = "37";  
$age['Joe'] = "43";
```

example code - 

```php
<?php  
$age = array("Peter"=>"35", "Ben"=>"37", "Joe"=>"43");  
echo "Peter is " . $age['Peter'] . " years old.";  
?>
```


### Loop Through an Associative Array

To loop through and print all the values of an associative array, you could use a `foreach` loop, like this:


```php
<?php  
$age = array("Peter"=>"35", "Ben"=>"37", "Joe"=>"43");  
  
foreach($age as $x => $x_value) {  
  echo "Key=" . $x . ", Value=" . $x_value;  
  echo "<br>";  
}  
?>
```

## PHP - Multidimensional Arrays

A multidimensional array is an array containing one or more arrays.

PHP supports multidimensional arrays that are two, three, four, five, or more levels deep. However, arrays more than three levels deep are hard to manage for most people.

## PHP - Sort Functions For Arrays


The elements in an array can be sorted in alphabetical or numerical order, descending or ascending.


- `sort()` - sort arrays in ascending order
- `rsort()` - sort arrays in descending order
- `asort()` - sort associative arrays in ascending order, according to the value
- `ksort()` - sort associative arrays in ascending order, according to the key
- `arsort()` - sort associative arrays in descending order, according to the value
- `krsort()` - sort associative arrays in descending order, according to the key
