## The Action Attribute

The `action` attribute defines the action to be performed when the form is submitted.

Usually, the form data is sent to a file on the server when the user clicks on the submit button.

In the example below, the form data is sent to a file called "action_page.php". This file contains a server-side script that handles the form data:

On submit, send form data to "action_page.php":

<form action="/action_page.php">  
  <label for="fname">First name:</label><br>  
  <input type="text" id="fname" name="fname" value="John"><br>  
  <label for="lname">Last name:</label><br>  
  <input type="text" id="lname" name="lname" value="Doe"><br><br>  
  <input type="submit" value="Submit">  
</form>

## The Method Attribute

The `method` attribute specifies the HTTP method to be used when submitting the form data.

The form-data can be sent as URL variables (with `method="get"`) or as HTTP post transaction (with `method="post"`).

The default HTTP method when submitting form data is GET.

This example uses the GET method when submitting the form data:

< form action="/action_page.php" method="get" >

This example uses the POST method when submitting the form data:

< form action="/action_page.php" method="post">





**Notes on GET:**

- Appends the form data to the URL, in name/value pairs
- NEVER use GET to send sensitive data! (the submitted form data is visible in the URL!)
- The length of a URL is limited (2048 characters)
- Useful for form submissions where a user wants to bookmark the result
- GET is good for non-secure data, like query strings in Google

**Notes on POST:**

- Appends the form data inside the body of the HTTP request (the submitted form data is not shown in the URL)
- POST has no size limitations, and can be used to send large amounts of data.
- Form submissions with POST cannot be bookmarked
