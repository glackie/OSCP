## The < div> Element

The `< div>` element is often used as a container for other HTML elements.

The `< div >` element has no required attributes, but `style`, `class` and `id` are common.

When used together with CSS, the `< div >` element can be used to style blocks of content:

<div style="background-color:white;color:black;padding:20px;">  
  <h2>London</h2>  
  <p>London is the capital city of England. It is the most populous city in the United Kingdom, with a metropolitan area of over 13 million inhabitants.</p>  
</div>
