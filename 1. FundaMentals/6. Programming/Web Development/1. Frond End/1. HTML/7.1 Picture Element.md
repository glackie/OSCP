## The HTML < picture > Element

The HTML `<picture >` element gives web developers more flexibility in specifying image resources.

The `<picture >` element contains one or more `<source >` elements, each referring to different images through the `srcset` attribute. 
This way the browser can choose the image that best fits the current view and/or device.

Each `<source >` element has a `media` attribute that defines when the image is the most suitable.


```
<picture>
  <source media="(min-width: 650px)" srcset="img_food.jpg">
  <source media="(min-width: 465px)" srcset="img_car.jpg">
  <img src="img_girl.jpg">
</picture> 
```
