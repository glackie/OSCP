## HTML Documents

All HTML documents must start with a document type declaration: `<!DOCTYPE html>`.

The HTML document itself begins with `<html>` and ends with `</html>`.

The visible part of the HTML document is between `<body>` and `</body>`.

## HTML Headings

HTML headings are defined with the `<h1>` to `<h6>` tags.

`<h1>` defines the most important heading. `<h6>` defines the least important heading:


## HTML Paragraphs

HTML paragraphs are defined with the `<p>` tag:

## HTML Links

HTML links are defined with the `<a>` tag:

### Example

```
<a href="https://www.w3schools.com">This is a link</a>
```


## HTML Images

HTML images are defined with the `<img>` tag.

The source file (`src`), alternative text (`alt`), `width`, and `height` are provided as attributes:

### Example

```
<img src="w3schools.jpg" alt="W3Schools.com" width="104" height="142">
```


## HTML is Not Case Sensitive

HTML tags are not case sensitive: `<P>` means the same as `<p>`.

## HTTP Comments

You can add comments to your HTML source by using the following syntax:

```
<!-- Write your comments here -->
