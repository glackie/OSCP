## HTML Events

An HTML event can be something the browser does, or something a user does.

Here are some examples of HTML events:

- An HTML web page has finished loading
- An HTML input field was changed
- An HTML button was clicked

Often, when events happen, you may want to do something.

JavaScript lets you execute code when events are detected.

HTML allows event handler attributes, **with JavaScript code**, to be added to HTML elements.

With single quotes:

```js
<element event='some JavaScript'>
```

In the following example, an `onclick` attribute (with code), is added to a `<button>` element:

### Example

```js
<button onclick="document.getElementById('demo').innerHTML = Date()">The time is?</button>
```

```js
<button onclick="this.innerHTML = Date()">The time is?</button>
```

```js
<button onclick="displayDate()">The time is?</button>
```
