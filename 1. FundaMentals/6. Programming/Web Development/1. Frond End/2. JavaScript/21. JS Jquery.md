## jQuery vs JavaScript

[jQuery](https://www.w3schools.com/jquery/default.asp) was created in 2006 by John Resig. It was designed to handle Browser Incompatibilities and to simplify HTML DOM Manipulation, Event Handling, Animations, and Ajax.

For more than 10 years, jQuery has been the most popular JavaScript library in the world.

However, after JavaScript [Version 5](https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_es5.asp) (2009), most of the jQuery utilities can be solved with a few lines of standard JavaScript:

---
## Finding HTML Element by Id

Return the element with id="id01":

### jQuery

```js
myElement = $("#id01");
```

### JavaScript

```js
myElement = document.getElementById("id01");
```


---

## Finding HTML Elements by Class Name

Return all elements with class="intro".

### jQuery

```js
myElements = $(".intro");
```

### JavaScript

```js
myElements = document.getElementsByClassName("intro");
```
