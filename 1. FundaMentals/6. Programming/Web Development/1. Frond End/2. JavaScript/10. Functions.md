A JavaScript function is a block of code designed to perform a particular task.

A JavaScript function is executed when "something" invokes it (calls it).'


```js
// Function to compute the product of p1 and p2  
function myFunction(p1, p2) {  
  return p1 * p2;  
}
```

## JavaScript Function Syntax

A JavaScript function is defined with the `function` keyword, followed by a **name**, followed by parentheses **()**.

```js
function _name_(_parameter1, parameter2, parameter3_) {  
  // _code to be executed_  
}
```

---
## Function Invocation

The code inside the function will execute when "something" **invokes** (calls) the function:

- When an event occurs (when a user clicks a button)
- When it is invoked (called) from JavaScript code
- Automatically (self invoked)

---

## Function Return

When JavaScript reaches a `return` statement, the function will stop executing.

If the function was invoked from a statement, JavaScript will "return" to execute the code after the invoking statement.

Functions often compute a **return value**. The return value is "returned" back to the "caller":

```js
// Function is called, the return value will end up in x  
let x = myFunction(4, 3);  
  
function myFunction(a, b) {  
// Function returns the product of a and b  
  return a * b;  
}
```

## Functions Used as Variable Values

Functions can be used the same way as you use variables, in all types of formulas, assignments, and calculations.

### Example

Instead of using a variable to store the return value of a function:

```js
let x = toCelsius(77);  
let text = "The temperature is " + x + " Celsius";
```

You can use the function directly, as a variable value:

```js
let text = "The temperature is " + toCelsius(77) + " Celsius";
```
