Formally, a function is a useful device that groups together a set of statements so they can be run more than once. They can also let us specify parameters that can serve as inputs to the functions.


```python
def name_of_function(arg1,arg2):
    '''
    This is where the function's Document String (docstring) goes
    '''
    # Do stuff here
    # Return desired result
```

examples:

```python
def say_hello():
    print('hello')


say_hello()
```


```python
def is_prime(num):
    '''
    Naive method of checking for primes. 
    '''
    for n in range(2,num):
        if num % n == 0:
            print(num,'is not prime')
            break
    else: # If never mod zero, then prime
        print(num,'is prime!')



is_prime(17)
```
