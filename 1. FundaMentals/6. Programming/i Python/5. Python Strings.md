1.) Creating Strings
```python

# We can also use double quote

"String built with double quotes"
'This is also a string'


```
2.) Printing Strings
```python
print('Hello World 1')
print('Hello World 2')
print('Use \n to print a new line')
print('\n')
print('See what I mean?')

```
3.) String Indexing and Slicing
```python
# Assign s as a string
s = 'Hello World'

# Print the object
print(s)


# Show first element (in this case a letter)
s[4]

# Grab everything past the first term all the way to the length of s which is len(s)
s[1:]



```
4.) String Properties
```python
# It's important to note that strings have an important property known as *immutability*. This means that once a string is created, the elements within it can not be changed or replaced. For example:

# Let's try to change the first letter to 'x'
s[0] = 'x' # This will give out an error


# We can reassign s completely though!
s = s + ' concatenate me!'

letter = 'z'
letter*10


```




5.) String Methods

```python

# Upper Case a string
s.upper()

# Lower case
s.lower()

# Split a string by blank space (this is the default)
s.split()

# Split by a specific element (doesn't include the element that was split on)
s.split('W')

```



6.) Print Formatting

```python

print('This is a string with an {}'.format('insert'))


print('A %s saved is a %s earned.' %('penny','penny'))
# vs.
print('A {p} saved is a {p} earned.'.format(p='penny'))




name = 'Fred'

print(f"He said his name is {name}.")

```
