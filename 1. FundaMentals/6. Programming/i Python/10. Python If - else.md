### Syntax

```python
    if case1:
        perform action1
    elif case2:
        perform action2
    else: 
        perform action3
```


examples:

```python
x = False

if x:
    print('x was True!')
else:
    print('I will be printed in any case where x is not true')
```


```python
loc = 'Bank'

if loc == 'Auto Shop':
    print('Welcome to the Auto Shop!')
elif loc == 'Bank':
    print('Welcome to the bank!')
else:
    print('Where are you?')
```


## Indentation

  
It is important to keep a good understanding of how indentation works in Python to maintain the structure and order of your code. 

We will touch on this topic again when we start building out functions!
