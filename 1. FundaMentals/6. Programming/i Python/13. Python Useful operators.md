### Range
```python

range(0,11,1)

# Notice how 11 is not included, up to but not including 11, just like slice notation!

list(range(0,11))

```
---
### enumerate

enumerate is a very useful function to use with for loops. Let's imagine the following situation:


```python
index_count = 0

for letter in 'abcde':
    print("At index {} the letter is {}".format(index_count,letter))
    index_count += 1
```

```python
# Notice the tuple unpacking!

for i,letter in enumerate('abcde'):
    print("At index {} the letter is {}".format(i,letter))
```
---
### Zip

```python
mylist1 = [1,2,3,4,5]
mylist2 = ['a','b','c','d','e']

# This one is also a generator! We will explain this later, but for now let's transform it to a list
zip(mylist1,mylist2)

list(zip(mylist1,mylist2))

# Output is - [(1, 'a'), (2, 'b'), (3, 'c'), (4, 'd'), (5, 'e')]

```
---
### in operator

```python
'x' in ['x','y','z']

# Output - True
```

---

### min and max

```python
mylist = [10,20,30,40,100]

min(mylist)
max(mylist)
```

---

### random

```python

from random import shuffle
# This shuffles the list "in-place" meaning it won't return
# anything, instead it will effect the list passed
shuffle(mylist)

mylist = [10,20,30,40,100]

mylist # Output - [40, 10, 100, 30, 20]
```

```python
from random import randint

# Return random integer in range [a, b], including both end points.
randint(0,100)

# Return random integer in range [a, b], including both end points.

randint(0,100)
```

---

### Input

```python
input('Enter Something into this box: ')
```

---

### List comprehensions

```python

# Grab every letter in string
lst = [x for x in 'word']


# Square numbers in range and turn into list
lst = [x**2 for x in range(0,11)]

# Check for even numbers in a range
lst = [x for x in range(11) if x % 2 == 0]

lst = [ x**2 for x in [x**2 for x in range(11)]]
```
