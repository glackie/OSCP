### Sets

```python

x = set()

# We add to sets with the add() method
x.add(1)

# Add a different element
x.add(2)

# Create a list with repeats
list1 = [1,1,2,2,3,4,5,6,1,1]

# Cast as set to get unique values
set(list1)
```


### Booleans

```python
# Set object to be a boolean
a = True

#We can use None as a placeholder for an object that we don't want to reassign yet:
# None placeholder
b = None

# Show
print(b)
```
