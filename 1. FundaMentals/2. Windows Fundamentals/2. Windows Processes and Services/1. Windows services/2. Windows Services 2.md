Service statuses can appear as Running, Stopped, or Paused, and they can be set to start manually, automatically, or on a delay at system boot. Services can also be shown in the state of Starting or Stopping if some action has triggered them to either start or stop.

**Windows has three categories of services: 
- Local Services
- Network Services
- System Services.

Services can usually only be created, modified, and deleted by users with administrative privileges. 

Misconfigurations around service permissions are a common privilege escalation vector on Windows systems.

In Windows, we have some [critical system services](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/rstmgr/critical-system-services) that cannot be stopped and restarted without a system restart.

If we update any file or resource in use by one of these services, we must restart the system.
