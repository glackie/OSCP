SAM grants rights to a network to execute specific processes.

The access rights themselves are managed by Access Control Entries (ACE) in Access Control Lists (ACL). 

The ACLs contain ACEs that define which users, groups, or processes have access to a file or to execute a process, for example.

The permissions to access a securable object are given by the security descriptor, classified into two types of ACLs: the `Discretionary Access Control List (DACL)` or `System Access Control List (SACL)`. 


Every thread and process started or initiated by a user goes through an authorization process. 

An integral part of this process is access tokens, validated by the Local Security Authority (LSA). In addition to the SID, these access tokens contain other security-relevant information. Understanding these functionalities is an essential part of learning how to use and work around these security mechanisms during the privilege escalation phase.
