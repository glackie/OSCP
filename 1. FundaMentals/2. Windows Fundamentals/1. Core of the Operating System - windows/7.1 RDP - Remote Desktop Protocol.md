RDP uses a client/server architecture where a client-side application is used to specify a computer's target IP address or hostname over a network where RDP access is enabled. The target computer where RDP remote access is enabled is considered the server. It is important to note that RDP listens by default on logical port `3389`.


We can use RDP to connect to a Windows target from an attack host running Linux or Windows. If we are connecting to a Windows target from a Windows host, we can use the built-in RDP client application called `Remote Desktop Connection` ([mstsc.exe](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/administration/windows-commands/mstsc)).

>Note:  For this to work, remote access must already be allowed on the target Windows system. By default, remote access is not allowed on Windows operating systems.

Remote Desktop Connection also allows us to save connection profiles. This is a common habit among IT admins because it makes connecting to remote systems more convenient.

>As pentesters, we can benefit from looking for these saved Remote Desktop Files (`.rdp`) while on an engagement.
