Types of Cryptography

Symmetric Encryption

Symmetric encryption (secret-key, shared-key, and private-key) uses the same key for encryption as it does for decryption




Asymmetric Encryption

Asymmetric encryption (public-key) uses different encryption keys, which are called public and private keys for encryption and decryption, respectively
