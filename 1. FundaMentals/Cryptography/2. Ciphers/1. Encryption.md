Encryption is the process of converting readable plaintext into an unreadable ciphertext using a set of complex algorithms that transform the data into blocks or streams of random alphanumeric characters.

This section deals with ciphers and various encryption algorithms such as DES, AES, RC4, RC5, RC6, DSA, RSA, MD5, SHA, etc.
