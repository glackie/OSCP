SSL is an application layer protocol developed by Netscape formanagingthe security of message transmission on
the Internet


It uses RSA asymmetric (public key) encryption to encrypt data transferred over SSL connections



SSL also offers "channelsecurity7' with three basic properties:

■ Private channel - All the messages are encrypted after a simple handshake is used to
define a secret key.

■ Authenticated channel - The server endpoint of the conversation is always encrypted,
whereas the client endpoint is optionally authenticated.

■ Reliable channel - Message transfer has an integrity check.
