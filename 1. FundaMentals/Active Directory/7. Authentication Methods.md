When using Windows domains, all credentials are stored in the Domain Controllers. 

Whenever a user tries to authenticate to a service using domain credentials, the service will need to ask the Domain Controller to verify if they are correct. 

Two protocols can be used for network authentication in windows domains:

-   **Kerberos:** Used by any recent version of Windows. This is the default protocol in any recent domain.
-   **NetNTLM:** Legacy authentication protocol kept for compatibility purposes.

While NetNTLM should be considered obsolete, most networks will have both protocols enabled. Let's take a deeper look at how each of these protocols works.
