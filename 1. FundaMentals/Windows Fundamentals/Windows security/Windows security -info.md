Security is a critical topic in Windows operating systems. 

Windows systems have many moving parts that present a vast attack surface. 

Due to the many built-in applications, features, and layers of settings, Windows systems can be easily misconfigured, thus opening them up to attack even if they are fully patched.

It has many built-in features that can be abused and has suffered from a wide variety of critical vulnerabilities, resulting in widely used and very effective remote and local exploits.

 As our world's interconnectedness continues to expand and attackers become more sophisticated, Microsoft has continued to add new features that can be used by systems administrators to harden systems and actively block and detect attempts at intrusion and misuse.

Windows follows certain security principles. 

These are units in the system that can be authorized or authenticated for a particular action. 

These units include users, computers on the network, threads, or processes. 

The principles are designed to make it more difficult for attackers or malicious software to gain unauthorized access and exploit the system in an unintended way.
