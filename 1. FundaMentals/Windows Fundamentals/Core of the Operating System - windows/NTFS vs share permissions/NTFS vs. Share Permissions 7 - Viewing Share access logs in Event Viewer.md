`Event Viewer`Â is another good place to investigate actions completed on Windows. Almost every operating system has a logging mechanism and a utility to view the logs that were captured. Know that a log is like a journal entry for a computer, where the computer writes down all the actions that were performed and numerous details associated with that action. We can view the logs created for every action we performed when accessing the Windows 10 target box, as well as when creating, editing and accessing the shared folder.
