## Front End

The front end of a web application contains the user's components directly through their web browser (client-side). These components make up the source code of the web page we view when visiting a web application and usually include `HTML`, `CSS`, and `JavaScript`, which is then interpreted in real-time by our browsers.

This includes everything that the user sees and interacts with.


Aside from frontend code development, the following are some of the other tasks related to front end web application development:

-   Visual Concept Web Design
-   User Interface (UI) design
-   User Experience (UX) design

There are many sites available to us to practice front end coding. One example is [this one](https://html-css-js.com/). Here we can play around with the [editor](https://htmlg.com/html-editor/), typing and formatting text and seeing the resulting `HTML`, `CSS`, and `JavaScript` being generated for us. Copy/paste this VERY simple example into the right hand side of the editor:

Code: html

```html
<p><strong>Welcome to Hack The Box Academy</strong><strong></strong></p>
<p></p>
<p><em>This is some italic text.</em></p>
<p></p>
<p><span style="color: #0000ff;">This is some blue text.</span></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
```

Watch the simple HTML code render on the left. Play around with the formatting, headers, colors, etc., and watch the code change.

## Back End

The back end of a web application drives all of the core web application functionalities, all of which is executed at the back end server, which processes everything required for the web application to run correctly. 

It is the part we may never see or directly interact with, but a website is just a collection of static web pages without a back end.

There are four main back end components for web applications:

**Component**

**Description**

`Back end Servers` - The hardware and operating system that hosts all other components and are usually run on operating systems like `Linux`, `Windows`, or using `Containers`.

`Web Servers` - Web servers handle HTTP requests and connections. Some examples are `Apache`, `NGINX`, and `IIS`.

`Databases` - Databases (`DBs`) store and retrieve the web application data. Some examples of relational databases are `MySQL`, `MSSQL`, `Oracle`, `PostgreSQL`, while examples of non-relational databases include `NoSQL` and `MongoDB`.

`Development Frameworks` - Development Frameworks are used to develop the core Web Application. Some well-known frameworks include `PHP`, `C#`, `Java`, `Python`, and `NodeJS JavaScript`.

Some of the main jobs performed by back end components include:

-   Develop the main logic and services of the back end of the web application
-   Develop the main code and functionalities of the web application
-   Develop and maintain the back end database
-   Develop and implement libraries to be used by the web application
-   Implemetation
-   Implement the main [APIs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/API) for front end component communications
-   Integrate remote servers and cloud services into the web application
