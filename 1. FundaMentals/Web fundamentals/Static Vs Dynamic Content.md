Static content, as the name suggests, is content that never changes. 
	Common examples of this are pictures, javascript, CSS, etc., but can also include HTML that never changes. 
	Furthermore, these are files that are directly served from the webserver with **no changes made to them**

Dynamic content, on the other hand, is content that could change with different requests. 
	Take, for example, a blog. On the homepage of the blog, it will show you the latest entries. If a new entry is created, the home page is then updated with the latest entry, or 
	a second example might be a search page on a blog. Depending on what word you search, different results will be displayed.

These changes to what you end up seeing are done in what is called the **Backend** with the use of programming and scripting languages. 

It's called the Backend because what is being done is all done behind the scenes. You can't view the websites' HTML source and see what's happening in the Backend, while the HTML is the result of the processing from the Backend. 

Everything you see in your browser is called the **Frontend.**
