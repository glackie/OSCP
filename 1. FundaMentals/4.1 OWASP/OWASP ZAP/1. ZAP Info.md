OWASP Zap is a security testing framework much like Burp Suite. It acts as a very robust enumeration tool. It’s used to test web applications.

---


There’s a couple of feature benefits too with using OWASP ZAP over Burp Suite:

- Automated Web Application Scan: This will automatically passively and actively scan a web application, build a sitemap, and discover vulnerabilities. This is a paid feature in Burp. 
    
- Web Spidering: You can passively build a website map with Spidering. This is a paid feature in Burp.
    
- Unthrottled Intruder: You can bruteforce login pages within OWASP as fast as your machine and the web-server can handle. This is a paid feature in Burp.
    
- No need to forward individual requests through Burp: When doing manual attacks, having to change windows to send a request through the browser, and then forward in burp, can be tedious. OWASP handles both and you can just browse the site and OWASP will intercept automatically. This is NOT a feature in Burp. 
    

If you’re already familiar with Burp the keywords translate over like so:
