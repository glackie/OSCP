Lets brute-force a form to get credentials. Although we already know the credentials, lets see if we can use Zap to obtain credentials through a Brute-Force attack.

  

If you wanted to do this with BurpSuite, you'd need to intercept the request, and then pass it to Hydra. However, this process is much easier with ZAP!

Navigate to the Brute Force page on DVWA and attempt login as “admin” with the password “test123”

Then, find the GET request and open the Fuzz menu.

Then highlight the password you attempted and add a wordlist. This selects the area of the request you wish to replace with other data.

For speed we can use fasttrack.txt which is located in your /usr/share/wordlists if you’re using Kali Linux.

After running the fuzzer, sort the state tab to show Reflected results first. Sometimes you will get false-positives, but you can ignore the passwords that are less than 8 characters in length.
