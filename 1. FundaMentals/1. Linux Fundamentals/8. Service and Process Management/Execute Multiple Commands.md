There are three possibilities to run several commands, one after the other. These are separated by:

-   Semicolon (`;`)
-   Double `ampersand` characters (`&&`)
-   Pipes (`|`)

The difference between them lies in the previous processes' treatment and depends on whether the previous process was completed successfully or with errors. 

The semicolon (`;`) is a command separator and executes the commands by ignoring previous commands' results and errors.
