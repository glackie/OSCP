- Platform as a service (PaaS) is a middle ground between renting space in a datacenter (infrastructure as a service) and paying for a complete and deployed solution (software as a service). 
- In a PaaS environment, the cloud provider maintains the physical infrastructure, physical security, and connection to the internet. 
- They also maintain the operating systems, middleware, development tools, and business intelligence services that make up a cloud solution. 
- In a PaaS scenario, you don't have to worry about the licensing or patching for operating systems and databases.

- PaaS is well suited to provide a complete development environment without the headache of maintaining all the development infrastructure.


## Scenarios

Some common scenarios where PaaS might make sense include:

- Development framework: PaaS provides a framework that developers can build upon to develop or customize cloud-based applications. Similar to the way you create an Excel macro, PaaS lets developers create applications using built-in software components. Cloud features such as scalability, high-availability, and multi-tenant capability are included, reducing the amount of coding that developers must do.
- Analytics or business intelligence: Tools provided as a service with PaaS allow organizations to analyze and mine their data, finding insights and patterns and predicting outcomes to improve forecasting, product design decisions, investment returns, and other business decisions.
