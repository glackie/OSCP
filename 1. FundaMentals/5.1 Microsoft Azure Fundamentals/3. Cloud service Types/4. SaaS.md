- Software as a service (SaaS) is the most complete cloud service model from a product perspective. 
- With SaaS, you’re essentially renting or using a fully developed application. 
- Email, financial software, messaging applications, and connectivity software are all common examples of a SaaS implementation.

- While the SaaS model may be the least flexible, it’s also the easiest to get up and running. It requires the least amount of technical knowledge or expertise to fully employ.

## Scenarios

Some common scenarios for SaaS are:

- Email and messaging.
