- Things like set templates help ensure that all your deployed resources meet corporate standards and government regulatory requirements. 
- Plus, you can update all your deployed resources to new standards as standards change. 
- Cloud-based auditing helps flag any resource that’s out of compliance with your corporate standards and provides mitigation strategies. 
- Depending on your operating model, software patches and updates may also automatically be applied, which helps with both governance and security.

- On the security side, you can find a cloud solution that matches your security needs. 
- If you want maximum control of security, infrastructure as a service provides you with physical resources but lets you manage the operating systems and installed software, including patches and maintenance. 
- If you want patches and maintenance taken care of automatically, platform as a service or software as a service deployments may be the best cloud strategies for you.

And because the cloud is intended as an over-the-internet delivery of IT resources, cloud providers are typically well suited to handle things like distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks, making your network more robust and secure.
