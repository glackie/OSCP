 It is always a good idea to familiarize ourselves with the tool we want to try first. 
 We will also learn some possible tricks with some of the tools that we thought were not possible. In the man pages, we will find the detailed manuals with detailed explanations.


```shell-session
glack@htb[/htb]$ man <tool>
```

 example: 
```shell-session
glack@htb[/htb]$ man curl
```

other method :

```shell-session
glack@htb[/htb]$ <tool> --help
```

short version of it: 

```shell-session
glack@htb[/htb]$ <tool> -h
```

Another tool that can be useful in the beginning is `apropos`. Each manual page has a short description available within it. This tool searches the descriptions for instances of a given keyword.
