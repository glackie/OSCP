Whether working as a system administrator, maintaining our own Linux machines at home, or building/upgrading/maintaining our penetration testing distribution of choice, it is crucial to have a firm grasp on the available Linux package managers and the various ways to utilize them to install, update, or remove packages. 

Packages are archives that contain binaries of software, configuration files, information about dependencies and keep track of updates and upgrades. 

The features that most package management systems provide are:

-   Package downloading
-   Dependency resolution
-   A standard binary package format
-   Common installation and configuration locations
-   Additional system-related configuration and functionality
-   Quality control
