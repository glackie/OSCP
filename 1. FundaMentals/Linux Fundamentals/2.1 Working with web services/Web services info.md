There are many different ways to set up web servers on Linux operating systems. 

One of the most used and widespread web servers, besides IIS and Nginx, is Apache. 

For an Apache web server, we can use appropriate modules, which can encrypt the communication between browser and web server (mod_ssl), use as a proxy server (mod_proxy), or perform complex manipulations of HTTP header data (mod_headers) and URLs (mod_rewrite).

Apache offers the possibility to create web pages dynamically using server-side scripting languages. Commonly used scripting languages are PHP, Perl, or Ruby. 

Other languages are Python, JavaScript, Lua, and .NET, which can be used for this. We can install the Apache webserver with the following command.

```shell-session
glack@htb[/htb]$ apt install apache2 -y
