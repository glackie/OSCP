*Below is just an example*


We can also download the programs and tools from the repositories separately.
In this example, we download 'strace' for Ubuntu 18.04 LTS.

```shell-session
glack@htb[/htb]$ wget http://archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/pool/main/s/strace/strace_4.21-1ubuntu1_amd64.deb

```

Now we have downloaded a file called *strace_4.21-1ubuntu1_amd64.deb*


Furthermore, now we can use both `apt` and `dpkg` to install the package. Since we have already worked with `apt`, we will turn to `dpkg` in the next example.

```shell-session
glack@htb[/htb]$ sudo dpkg -i strace_4.21-1ubuntu1_amd64.deb

With this, we have already installed the tool called strace
