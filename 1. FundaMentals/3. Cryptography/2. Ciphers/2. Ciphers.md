Ciphers are algorithms used to
encrypt or decrypt the data


In cryptography, a cipher is an algorithm (a series of well-defined steps) for performing
encryption and decryption.


Types of ciphers

1. Classic Ciphers
	1. substitution Cipher - A block of plaintext is replaced with ciphertext
	2. Transposition cipher - The letters of the plaintext are shifted about to form the cryptogram

2. Modern Ciphers
	1. Based on the type of key used
		1. Private Key
		2. Public Key
	2. Based on the type of input data
		1. Block Cipher - Encyrpts blocks of data with fixed size
		2. Stream Cipher - Encrypts Continuos Streams of Data
