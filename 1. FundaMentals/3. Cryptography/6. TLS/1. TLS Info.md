TLS is a protocol to establish a secure connection between a client and a server and ensure the privacy
and integrity of information during transmission


It uses the RSA algorithm with 1024-and 2048-bit strengths


TLS consists of two layers: TLS Record Protocol and TLS Handshake Protocol.

1. TLS Record Protocol
The TLS Record Protocol is a layered protocol. It provides secured connections with an
encryption method such as DES. It secures application data using the keys generated
during the handshake and verifies its integrity and origin.



2. TLS Handshake Protocol
The TLS Handshake Protocol allows the client and server to authenticate each other and select an encryption algorithm and cryptographic keys prior to data exchange by the application protocol.
