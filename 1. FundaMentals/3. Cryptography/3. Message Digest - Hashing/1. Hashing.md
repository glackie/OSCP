Hash functions calculate a unique fixed-size bit string representation called a message digest of any arbitrary
block of information


If any given bit of the function's input is changed, then every output bit has a 50 percent chance of changing


It is computationally infeasible to have two files with the same message digest value



Note: Message digests are also called one-way hash functions because they cannot be reversed
