The steps involved in the PKI process are as follows:
1.
The subject (user, company, or system) intending to exchange information securely applies for a certificate to the registration authority (RA).
2.
The RA receives the request from the subject, verifies the subject's identity, and requests the CA to issue a public key certificate to the user.
3.
The CA issues the public key certificate binding the subject's identity with the subject's public key; then, the updated information is sent to the validation authority (VA).
4.
When a user makes a transaction, the user duly signs the message digitally using the public key certificate and sends the message to the client.
5.
The client verifies the authenticity of the user by inquiring with the VA about the validity of the user's public key certificate.
6.
The VA compares the public key certificate of the user with that of the updated information provided by the CA and determines the result )valid or invalid).
