] A digital signature is a cryptographic means
of authentication. 

Public-key cryptography uses asymmetric encryption and helps the user to
create a digital signature. 

The two types of keys in public-key cryptography are the private key
(only the signer knows this key and uses it to create a digital signature) and the public key (it is
widely known and the relying party uses it to verify the digital signature).

A hash function is an algorithm that helps a user to create and verify a digital signature. 
This algorithm creates a digital representation, also known as the message fingerprint.
This fingerprint has a hash value that is much smallerthan the message, but one that is unique to it. If the attacker
changes the message, the hash function will automatically produce a different hash value.
