A [Caesar cipher](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caesar_cipher), rotation cipher or shift cipher is a simple substitution cipher where the cleartext is shifted a number of times up or down a known alphabet.

Example: The letter A shifted by 1 place in the alphabet becomes B


The [Caesar cipher](https://www.dcode.fr/caesar-cipher) is a shift cipher, usually presented with a shift key of value 3.

### How to decrypt using the shift cipher?

Decryption requires knowing the shift used and the alphabet.

Take a letter in [position N in the alphabet](https://www.dcode.fr/letter-number-cipher) that has been encrypted by a shift of X, it must be shifted by -X to return to its original position N-X.

Example: The letter H in [position 8 in the alphabet](https://www.dcode.fr/letter-number-cipher) ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ, will be decrypted from a shift of 3 in position 8-3=5 or E.

Example: The word TIJGU is decoded with an offset of 1 as SHIFT
