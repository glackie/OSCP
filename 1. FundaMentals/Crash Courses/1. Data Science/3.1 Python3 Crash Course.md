Python is an extremely versatile, high-level programming language. It is often highly regarded as easy to learn. Here are some examples of how it can be used:

- Web development
- Game development
- Exploit development in Cybersecurity
- Desktop application development
- Artificial intelligence
- Data Science

One of the first things you learn when learning a programming language is how to print text. Python makes this extremely simple by using `print(“your text here”)`.
