The core element of data science is interpreting data to answer questions. Data science often involves programming, statistics, and, recently, the use of Artificial Intelligence (AI) to examine large amounts of data to understand trends and patterns and help businesses make predictions that lead to informed decisions.

The roles and responsibilities of a data scientist include:

|   |   |
|---|---|
|**Role**|**Description**|
|Data Collection|This phase involves collecting the raw data. This could be a list of recent transactions, for example.|
|Data Processing|This phase involves turning the raw data that was previously collected into a standard format the analyst can work with. This phase can be quite the time-sink!|
|Data Mining (Clustering/Classification)|This phase involves creating relationships between the data, finding patterns and correlations that can start to provide some insight. Think of it like chipping away at a big stone, discovering more and more as you chip away.|
|Analysis (Exploratory/Confirmatory)|This phase is where the bulk of the analysis takes place. Here, the data is explored to provide answers to questions and some future projections. For example, an e-commerce store can use data science to understand the latest and most popular products to sell, as well as create a prediction for the busiest times of the year.|
|Communication (Visualisation)|This phase is extremely important. Even if you have the answers to the Universe, no one will understand you if you can't present them clearly. Data can be visualised as charts, tables, maps, etc.|
