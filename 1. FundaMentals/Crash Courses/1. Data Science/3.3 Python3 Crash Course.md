The Notebook for this section can be found in `3_IntroToMatplotib -> IntroToMatplotlib.ipynb`. Remember to press the “Run Cell” button (Shift + Enter) as you progress through the Notebook.

Matplotlib allows us to quickly create a large variety of plots. For example, bar charts, histograms, pie charts, waterfalls, and all sorts!
