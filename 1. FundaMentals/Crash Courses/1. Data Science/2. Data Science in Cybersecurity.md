The use of data science is quickly becoming more frequent in Cybersecurity because of its ability to offer insights. Analysing data, such as log events, leads to an intelligent understanding of ongoing events within an organisation. Using data science for anomaly detection is an example. Other uses of data science in Cybersecurity include:

- **SIEM:** SIEMs collect and correlate large amounts of data to give a wider understanding of the organisation’s landscape.
- **Threat trend analysis:** Emerging threats can be tracked and understood.
- **Predictive analysis:** By analysing historical events, you can create a potential picture of what the threat landscape may look like in the future. This can aid in the prevention of incidents.
