### Configuring Firewalls to Block Traffic

Van Twinkle knows that the uncomplicated firewall is the default firewall configuration tool available on Ubuntu hosts, and she decides to use it for this experiment. Initially, it's turned off by default, so we can check the status by running the command below:

UFW Status

```shell-session
vantwinkle@aocday13:~$ sudo ufw status
Status inactive
```

We don't currently have any rules, so we can define default rules to allow or block traffic. These can be set to deny all incoming connections and allow outgoing connections.

UFW Default Policies

```shell-session
vantwinkle@aocday13:~$ sudo ufw default allow outgoing
Default outgoing policy changed to 'allow'
(be sure to update your rules accordingly

vantwinkle@aocday13:~$ sudo ufw default deny incoming
Default incoming policy changed to 'deny'
(be sure to update your rules accordingly
```

Additionally, we can add, modify, and delete rules by specifying an IP address, port number, service name, or protocol. In this example, we can add a rule to allow legitimate incoming connections to port 22, which would allow connectivity via SSH. We should get two confirmation messages indicating that the rule has been implemented for IPv4 and IPv6 connections.

Adding a Firewall rule with a port number and protocol

```shell-session
vantwinkle@aocday13:~$ sudo ufw  allow 22/tcp
Rules updated
Rules updated (v6)
```

Firewall rules can get more complex, incorporating specific IP addresses, subnets or even specific network interfaces.

UFW Deny Rules

```shell-session
vantwinkle@aocday13:~$ sudo ufw deny from 192.168.100.25
Rule added

vantwinkle@aocday13:~$ sudo ufw deny in on eth0 from 192.168.100.26
Rule added
```

Once we have added our rules, we can enable the service and check the rules set.

Enabling UFW

```shell-session
vantwinkle@aocday13:~$ sudo ufw enable
Firewall is active and enabled on system startup

vantwinkle@aocday13:~$ sudo ufw status verbose
Status: active
Logging: on (low)
Default: deny (incoming), allow (outgoing), disabled (routed)
New profiles: skip
           
To                  Action        From
--                  -------       ----
22/tcp              ALLOW IN    Anywhere
22/tcp (v6)         ALLOW IN    Anywhere (v6)
Anywhere            DENY        192.168.100.25
Anywhere on eth0    DENY IN     192.168.100.26
```

What happens if the rules are incorrectly configured? We can reset the firewall and, revert to its default state and be able to configure the rules fresh.

Resetting UFW

```shell-session
vantwinkle@aocday13:~$ sudo ufw reset
Resetting all rules to installed defaults. This may disrupt existing ssh
connections. Proceed with operation (y|n)? y
Backing up 'user.rules' to '/etc/ufw/user.rules.20231105_130227'
Backing up 'before.rules' to '/etc/ufw/before.rules.20231105_130227'
Backing up 'after.rules' to '/etc/ufw/after.rules.20231105_130227'

Backing up 'after6.rules' to '/etc/ufw/after6.rules.20231105_130227'
```

At this point, Van Twinkle has a much deeper understanding of how to set up and configure firewall rules to help McHoneyBell implement Santa's defences.
