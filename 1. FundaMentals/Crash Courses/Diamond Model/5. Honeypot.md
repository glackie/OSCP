This is another intriguing piece of infrastructure in the world of defensive security. Picture a trap laid for the attackers, a mirage of vulnerability tempting them away from the true treasures. Behold, the honeypot!

A honeypot is a cyber security mechanism – a masterful deception. It presents itself as an alluring target to the adversaries, drawing them away from the true prizes. Honeypots come in various forms: software applications, servers, or entire networks. They are designed to mimic legitimate targets, yet they are under the watchful control of the defender. For the Best Festival Company, envision a honeypot masquerading as Santa's website – a perfect replica of the real one.

Honeypots can be classified into two main types:

- **Low–interaction honeypots:** These honeypots artfully mimic simple systems like web servers or databases. They gather intelligence on attacker behaviour and detect new attack techniques.
- **High–interaction honeypots:** These honeypots take deception to new heights, emulating complex systems like operating systems and networks. They collect meticulous details on attacker behaviour and study their techniques to exploit vulnerabilities.

To demonstrate how to set up a honeypot, we'll use a tool called **PenTBox**, which has already been installed on the VM under `/home/vantwinkle/pentbox/pentbox-1.8`. Launch the tool via the directory demonstrated below, select option 2 for network tools, and follow with option 3 to install the honeypot.



Honeypot Installation with PenTBox

```shell-session
vantwinkle@aocday13:~/pentbox/pentbox-1.8$ sudo ./pentbox.rb
           
PenTBox 1.8

```

When we select the option to set up the honeypot, we can choose to set up an auto-configuration or a manual configuration. The manual configuration offers more options to allocate which port to open and a custom message for the honeypot to display. Accompanying these options, log data will be collected and displayed on the terminal for every intrusion encountered.

With the active honeypot, we can attempt to connect to the VM by navigating to on the AttackBox browser. You should see the custom message crafted from the honeypot. Once connected, the intrusion will trigger an alert on the honeypot, and a log will be created showing the attacking IP and port.  

Honeypot Installation with PenTBox

```shell-session
1- Fast Auto Configuration
2- Manual Configuration
           
-> 2
           
Insert port to Open
-> 8080
Insert false message to show
-> Santa has gone for the Holidays. Tough luck.
