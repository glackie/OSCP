The mighty firewall is a guardian of networks and a sentinel of cyber security! This network security device stands vigilant, monitoring and controlling the ebb and flow of incoming and outgoing network traffic. With its predetermined security rules, a firewall can repel a wide range of threats, from unauthorised access to malicious traffic and even attempts to breach sensitive data.

Firewalls come in many forms, including hardware, software, or a combination. Their presence is vital, a cornerstone of any cyber security defence strategy. The following are the common types of firewalls that exist:

- **Stateless/packet-filtering:** This firewall provides the most straightforward functionality by inspecting and filtering individual network packets based on a set of rules that would point to a source or destination IP address, ports and protocols. The firewall doesn’t consider any context of each connection when making decisions and effectively blocks denial–of–service attacks and port scans.
- **Stateful inspection:** This firewall is more sophisticated. It is used to track the state of network connections and use this information to make filtering decisions. For example, if a packet being channelled to the network is part of an established connection, the stateful firewall will let it pass through. However, the packet will be blocked if it is not part of an established connection.
- **Proxy service:** This firewall protects the network by filtering messages at the application layer, providing deep packet inspection and more granular control over traffic content. The firewall can block access to certain websites or block the transmission of specific types of files.
- **Web application firewall (WAF):** This firewall is designed to protect web applications. WAFs block common web attacks such as SQL injection, cross-site scripting, and denial-of-service attacks.
- **Next-generation firewall:** This firewall combines the functionalities of the stateless, stateful, and proxy firewalls with features such as intrusion detection and prevention and content filtering.

For the remainder of the task, we shall focus on one application of a stateful inspection firewall in the form of the uncomplicated firewall (ufw).
