Unlike the robots.txt file, which restricts what search engine crawlers can look at, the sitemap.xml file gives a list of every file the website owner wishes to be listed on a search engine. 

These can sometimes contain areas of the website that are a bit more difficult to navigate to or even list some old webpages that the current site no longer uses but are still working behind the scenes.


Example:

Take a look at the sitemap.xml file on the Acme IT Support website to see if there's any new content we haven't yet discovered:Â 

[http://<hostname>/sitemap.xml 

(open this in the FireFox browser on the AttackBox).
