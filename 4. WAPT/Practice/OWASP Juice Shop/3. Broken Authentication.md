## A. Bruteforce the Administrator account's password!


```
username to use: admin@juice-sh.op
```

```
_You can load the list from:_ _/usr/share/wordlists/SecLists/Passwords/Common-Credentials/best1050.txt_
```


I get a hit with creds
```
admin@juice-sh.op
admin123
```


```

## B. Reset Jim's password!


Believe it or not, the reset password mechanism can also be exploited! When inputted into the email field in the Forgot Password page, Jim's security question is set to _"Your eldest siblings middle name?"_.

  

In Task 2, we found that Jim might have something to do with Star Trek. Googling "Jim Star Trek" gives us a wiki page for Jame T. Kirk from Star Trek. 
  

Looking through the wiki page we find that he has a brother.

Looks like his brother's middle name is **Samuel**

Inputting that into the Forgot Password page allows you to successfully change his password.

You can change it to anything you want!
