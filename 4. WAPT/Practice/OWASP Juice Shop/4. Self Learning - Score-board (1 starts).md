```

I did the same thing to other xss payload and got the flag

`<iframe src="javascript:alert(`xss`)">`

I also tried this other simple payload in the same value field but got nothing
`<script>window.alert(1+2)</script>`

Here i found out the minimum start i can give in the browser is 1 start so maybe i can intercept the req change maybe change the value 

and so i did

`"rating":1` to `"rating":0`

A.7 Question


Retrieve the photo of Bjoern's cat in "melee combat-mode".


also stuck here, going for writeup

This was the solution: 


Navigate to `http://localhost:3000/#/photo-wall`.

`http://localhost:3000/assets/public/images/uploads/%F0%9F%98%BC-#zatschi-#whoneedsfourlegs-1572600969477.jpg`

The hashtags are restricted characters (HTML anchors), so replace them with the URL encoding %23.

`http://localhost:3000/assets/public/images/uploads/%F0%9F%98%BC-%23zatschi-%23whoneedsfourlegs-1572600969477.jpg`
