This lab contains a [DOM-based cross-site scripting](https://portswigger.net/web-security/cross-site-scripting/dom-based) vulnerability in the search query tracking functionality. It uses the JavaScript `document.write` function, which writes data out to the page. The `document.write` function is called with data from `location.search`, which you can control using the website URL.

To solve this lab, perform a [cross-site scripting](https://portswigger.net/web-security/cross-site-scripting) attack that calls the `alert` function.

 i did what i alredy know and that is put injection directly into the URL
https://0a980017046ef182c00f721b00e5003d.web-security-academy.net/?search=chek%3Cscript%3Ealert(1)%3C/script%3E

Injection: <script>alert(1)</script>

didnt work so looking into souce source code nad other stuff


SOLUTION

1.  Enter a random alphanumeric string into the search box.
2.  Right-click and inspect the element, and observe that your random string has been placed inside an `img src` attribute.
3.  Break out of the `img` attribute by searching for:
    
    `"><svg onload=alert(1)>`

Ok

Injection command was 

`"><svg onload=alert(1)>`


Here the key was to check the script using inspect element


Below is the script in source code, here we notice that to escape the script function we basically added below to escape from the original script to input our own script

>">

                        function trackSearch(query) {
                            document.write('<img src="/resources/images/tracker.gif?searchTerms='+query+'">');
                        }
                        var query = (new URLSearchParams(window.location.search)).get('search');
                        if(query) {
                            trackSearch(query);
                        }


i will continue XSS labs after i learn some basic javasprict and other languages
