This lab contains a [file path traversal](https://portswigger.net/web-security/file-path-traversal) vulnerability in the display of product images.

The application blocks traversal sequences but treats the supplied filename as being relative to a default working directory.

To solve the lab, retrieve the contents of the `/etc/passwd` file.

Pretty much the same as previous one but only this time the difference is that

the developer has instructed that we can only view the files that are given in the images path only

now we want to bypass that


another thing i noticed is that 


when i see what are the diffent packets sent to the server through browser i am able to see that a packet for below URL is sent
https://0a1d001604132313c0151d09008300a2.web-security-academy.net/image?filename=40.jpg


However when i check the same in burpsuite this request was not there, when i resent it using developer console 
only then i was able to see it in the burp 

Moving on

Okay i went dep into it and say the in burp proxy http history we can filter images and other such request i just removed it and now we are good to go


I used my [[4. Local File Inclusion - LFI]] notes to try it but it is not working when i changes the filename patamter to (other variations as well)

40.jpg/../../../../etc/passwd

then i tried below paramter as well

images/40.jpg/../../../etc/passwd


Still no luck so i went with the solution

1.  Use Burp Suite to intercept and modify a request that fetches a product image.
2.  Modify the `filename` parameter, giving it the value `/etc/passwd`.
3.  Observe that the response contains the contents of the `/etc/passwd` file.


in this case i didnt have to put "../"


i tried it but was not getting results now going with community solution

okay i was trying these attacks from repeater and may have made some mistake with encoding stuff

i recaptured that packet and tried the attack again and it worked
