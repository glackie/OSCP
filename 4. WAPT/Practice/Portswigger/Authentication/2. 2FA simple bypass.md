This lab's two-factor authentication can be bypassed. You have already obtained a valid username and password, but do not have access to the user's 2FA verification code. To solve the lab, access Carlos's account page.

-   Your credentials: `wiener:peter`
-   Victim's credentials `carlos:montoya`

lets see what we find when we access the lab

so i thought when we login our email must be sent and i can intercept that packet the change the email to my own however that was not case, after not finding anything i went for the solution

1.  Log in to your own account. Your 2FA verification code will be sent to you by email. Click the **Email client** button to access your emails.
2.  Go to your account page and make a note of the URL.
3.  Log out of your account.
4.  Log in using the victim's credentials.
5.  When prompted for the verification code, manually change the URL to navigate to `/my-account`. The lab is solved when the page loads.
