This lab has an admin panel at `/admin`. It's only accessible to logged-in users with a `roleid` of 2.

Solve the lab by accessing the admin panel and using it to delete the user `carlos`.

You can log in to your own account using the following credentials: `wiener:peter`

firstly i logged in as weiner

tried to access the admin page


so iwen back to my profile page and updated the email

and in the response i got this


{
  "username": "wiener",
  "email": "cg@gmail.com",
  "apikey": "r6d5mQcqKRPIZUsrPIFQ69E4weGDKNOq",
  "roleid": 1
}



now i got an idea that roleid paramter has to be changed to login as admin and access the /admin


I went back to the my-account URL 

https://0a1800430367a285c238071f00340013.web-security-academy.net/my-account?id=wiener

still coundnt figure it out and went for the solution

1.  Log in using the supplied credentials and access your account page.
2.  Use the provided feature to update the email address associated with your account.
3.  Observe that the response contains your role ID.
4.  Send the email submission request to Burp Repeater, add `"roleid":2` into the JSON in the request body, and resend it.
5.  Observe that the response shows your `roleid` has changed to 2.
6.  Browse to `/admin` and delete `carlos`.


i tried this but still coundt figure it out so went for community solution video

Understood my mistake


i didnt put a comma before putting the roleid into JSON in the request body
