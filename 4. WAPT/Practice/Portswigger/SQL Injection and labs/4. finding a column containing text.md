This lab contains an SQL injection vulnerability in the product category filter. 

The results from the query are returned in the application's response, so you can use a UNION attack to retrieve data from other tables. 

To construct such an attack, you first need to determine the number of columns returned by the query. 

You can do this using a technique you learned in a [previous lab](https://portswigger.net/web-security/sql-injection/union-attacks/lab-determine-number-of-columns). The next step is to identify a column that is compatible with string data.

The lab will provide a random value that you need to make appear within the query results. 

To solve the lab, perform an [SQL injection UNION](https://portswigger.net/web-security/sql-injection/union-attacks) attack that returns an additional row containing the value provided. This technique helps you determine which columns are compatible with string data.

this one here follows the same pattern  and we first need to determine how many columsa re there using the null technique used in previous lab

after trying I found out that there are three columns in the table
 to get this i changed the paramter value in burp suite to 
<mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;"> Make sure to check status code received from the server to validate if correct or not</mark>
>Gifts' UNION SELECT NULL,NULL,NULL--

Now we know that there are three columns in the table

Here i noticed that in the web page there was a statement given as 

>Make the database retrieve the string: 'tjoNgY'

i tried multiple request using this string such as

>Gifts' UNION SELECT * FROM NULL,NULL,NULL WHERE 'tjoNgY'--

but they were not working so i went for the solution

Now i knew my mistake what what i had to do was this
>-   Try replacing each null with the random value provided by the lab, for example:
    
    `'+UNION+SELECT+'abcdef',NULL,NULL--`


again i was trying above solution but not luck

i tried three variation of paramter like below

Gifts' UNION SELECT NULL,NULL,'tjoNgY'--


i think i was making some typos after trying multiple times i finally made it working using below parmater value

<mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">Gifts' UNION SELECT NULL,'tjoNgY',NULL--</mark>
