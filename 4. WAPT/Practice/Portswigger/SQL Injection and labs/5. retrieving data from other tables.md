This lab contains an SQL injection vulnerability in the product category filter. The results from the query are returned in the application's response, so you can use a UNION attack to retrieve data from other tables. To construct such an attack, you need to combine some of the techniques you learned in previous labs.

The database contains a different table called `users`, with columns called `username` and `password`.

To solve the lab, perform an [SQL injection UNION](https://portswigger.net/web-security/sql-injection/union-attacks) attack that retrieves all usernames and passwords, and use the information to log in as the `administrator` user.

-   Use the following payload to retrieve the contents of the `users` table:
    
    `'+UNION+SELECT+username,+password+FROM+users--`
-   Verify that the application's response contains usernames and passwords.
