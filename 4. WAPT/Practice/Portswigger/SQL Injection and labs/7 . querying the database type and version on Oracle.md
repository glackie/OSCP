This lab contains an [SQL injection](https://portswigger.net/web-security/sql-injection) vulnerability in the product category filter. You can use a UNION attack to retrieve the results from an injected query.

To solve the lab, display the database version string.

when i saw i had to get the version details i immediately thought we can this thorugh erros message we get from the server so lets try that

no luck after trying random queries

since hacing no knowledge of oracle i tried with HINT

<mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;">HINT</mark>

On Oracle databases, every `SELECT` statement must specify a table to select `FROM`. 

If your `UNION SELECT` attack does not query from a table, you will still need to include the `FROM` keyword followed by a valid table name.

There is a built-in table on Oracle called `dual` which you can use for this purpose. For example: `UNION SELECT 'abc' FROM dual`

For more information, see our [SQL injection cheat sheet](https://portswigger.net/web-security/sql-injection/cheat-sheet).

now i tried that above hint

in the cheatsheet i found this tatement

>You can query the database to determine its type and version. This information is useful when formulating more complicated attacks.

>Oracle

>`SELECT banner FROM v$version   SELECT version FROM v$instance`

with no luck i jumped to solution and htere it was in my face the solution that we had been trying in preious labs

After watching the community solution video i tried below vlaue and got 200 OK response

><mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">Tech gifts' UNION SELECT NULL,NULL FROM DUAL--</mark>



now i tired to whceck whih null value(colum has strings in it)

><mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">Tech gifts' UNION SELECT 'abc','abc' FROM DUAL--</mark>


both NULL columns has strings in it

Now 

as per solution trying the given solution

solved the lab using below value


><mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">Tech gifts' UNION SELECT BANNER,NULL FROM v$version--</mark>
