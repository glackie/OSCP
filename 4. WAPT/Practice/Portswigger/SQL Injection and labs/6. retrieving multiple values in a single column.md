<mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">Q</mark>

This lab contains an SQL injection vulnerability in the product category filter. The results from the query are returned in the application's response so you can use a UNION attack to retrieve data from other tables.

The database contains a different table called `users`, with columns called `username` and `password`.

To solve the lab, perform an [SQL injection UNION](https://portswigger.net/web-security/sql-injection/union-attacks) attack that retrieves all usernames and passwords, and use the information to log in as the `administrator` user.
