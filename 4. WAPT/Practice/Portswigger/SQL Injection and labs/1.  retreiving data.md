This lab contains an [SQL injection](https://portswigger.net/web-security/sql-injection) vulnerability in the product category filter. 

When the user selects a category, the application carries out an SQL query like the following:

`SELECT * FROM products WHERE category = 'Gifts' AND released = 1`

To solve the lab, perform an SQL injection attack that causes the application to display details of all products in any category, both released and unreleased.

I was not able to solve it

Here we saw that the SQL command that was sent to the server was alraedy given in the question so i didnt have to search it

Now when we go to target URL and search any category filter and intercept through burp(burp here is optional we can achieve the same without burp)

target url: 

https://0a5e000a04541b6cc0488122002800b5.web-security-academy.net/filter?category=Pets

Upon inspecting the URL i understood that we add to add what we want after the "pets" but didnt know what it was and used the solution

Solution was that we can either using burp to add the injection or directly though web browser URL

attack url is

https://0a5e000a04541b6cc0488122002800b5.web-security-academy.net/filter?category=Pets%27%20or%201=1--


injection command: <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">' or 1=1--</mark>
