This lab contains an SQL injection vulnerability in the product category filter. 

The results from the query are returned in the application's response, so you can use a UNION attack to retrieve data from other tables. 

The first step of such an attack is to determine the number of columns that are being returned by the query.

You will then use this technique in subsequent labs to construct the full attack.

To solve the lab, determine the number of columns returned by the query by performing an [SQL injection UNION](https://portswigger.net/web-security/sql-injection/union-attacks) attack that returns an additional row containing null values.

<mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;">what we know</mark>:

1. vuln in product category filter

2. The results from the query are returned in the application's response

Now as i didnt know about UNION SQL Commands i just ran a quick internet check and wrote what i found in [[SQL UNION and Cheatsheet]]


i tried the injection command i tried in previous labs to see if it is working and it worked

https://0ad800360393c8eec05e9f8500df007d.web-security-academy.net/filter?category=Pets%27%20or%201=1--

after trying some random commands and it didnt work i went striaght for the solution

-   Modify the `category` parameter, giving it the value `'+UNION+SELECT+NULL--`. Observe that an error occurs.
-   Modify the `category` parameter to add an additional column containing a null value:
    
    `'+UNION+SELECT+NULL,NULL--`
-   Continue adding null values until the error disappears and the response includes additional content containing the null values.

i tried doing what was written in the solution 

Even after checking the solution I was not able to solve the lab and felt terrible

I then watched the community solution video below it

i learnt that when i directly put the injection command on the browser url it as not working(later i realized i was because i forgot to put the ' )


then itried to resent the packets thorough web browser developer console network tab

i tried with only one NULL, then two, and three

This is what i added to the parameter to complete the lab

<mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;">' UNION SELECT NULL,NULL,NULL--</mark>

>Dont forget to put the ' after the original query
