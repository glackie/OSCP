## DOM-based cross-site scripting

DOM-based XSS (also known as [DOM XSS](https://portswigger.net/web-security/cross-site-scripting/dom-based)) arises when an application contains some client-side JavaScript that processes data from an untrusted source in an unsafe way, usually by writing the data back to the DOM.


>The Document Object Model (DOM) is **a programming API for HTML and XML documents**It defines the logical structure of documents and the way a document is accessed and manipulated. 
>In the DOM specification, the term "document" is used in the broad sense - increasingly, XML is being used as a way of representing many different kinds of information that may be stored in diverse systems, and much of this would traditionally be seen as data rather than as documents. 
>Nevertheless, XML presents this data as documents, and the DOM may be used to manage this data.

In the following example, an application uses some JavaScript to read the value from an input field and write that value to an element within the HTML:

`var search = document.getElementById('search').value; var results = document.getElementById('results'); results.innerHTML = 'You searched for: ' + search;`

If the attacker can control the value of the input field, they can easily construct a malicious value that causes their own script to execute:

`You searched for: <img src=1 onerror='/* Bad stuff here... */'>`

In a typical case, the input field would be populated from part of the HTTP request, such as a URL query string parameter, allowing the attacker to deliver an attack using a malicious URL, in the same manner as reflected XSS.
