Not solved

This lab contains a [file path traversal](https://portswigger.net/web-security/file-path-traversal) vulnerability in the display of product images.

The application strips [path traversal](https://portswigger.net/web-security/file-path-traversal) sequences from the user-supplied filename before using it.

To solve the lab, retrieve the contents of the `/etc/passwd` file.

firstly i tried preios lab solution nad it obviously didnt work


from what i can understand it filters the ../../../ after user inputs it


So from what i read in [[Local File Inclusion - LFI 3]]

i tried this as parameter value

....//....//....//etc/passwd


and it worked. Finally i was able to view the contents of /etc/passwd in burp response




also i learnt what mistake i was making in last lab

i was putting encoded values as input but url was not getting encoded and thats why it was not working
