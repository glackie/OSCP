This lab contains a [file path traversal](https://portswigger.net/web-security/file-path-traversal) vulnerability in the display of product images.

The application transmits the full file path via a request parameter, and validates that the supplied path starts with the expected folder.

To solve the lab, retrieve the contents of the `/etc/passwd` file.

Hwere when i capture the image parmaater packet i can see that the full path is given and the application checks if the start of the path is same is given in the packet.


so all i did was added the injection at the end of the path replacing image name

The final injection in the packet was:

/image?filename=/var/www/images/../../../etc/passwd 


and i was able to complete the lab without the solution lol
