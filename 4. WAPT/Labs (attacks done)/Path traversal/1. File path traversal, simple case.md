This lab contains a [file path traversal](https://portswigger.net/web-security/file-path-traversal) vulnerability in the display of product images.

To solve the lab, retrieve the contents of the `/etc/passwd` file.

Target Link:


https://0a08001204ec4bacc0d3133c002a00c3.web-security-academy.net/product?productId=1


I am trying multiple variations of below paramter


https://0a08001204ec4bacc0d3133c002a00c3.web-security-academy.net/product?productId=../../../../../etc/passwd%00


but it is not working and i am also not receiving any errors


Tried to see if any php files in source code but no luck


I read the quetion again and it says vulnerability in in the display of product images

in the source code i found a path but it was not accessible

https://0a08001204ec4bacc0d3133c002a00c3.web-security-academy.net/resources/images


upon trying when i clicked the hyper link in the source code i was able to go to URL and view the image

view-source:https://0a08001204ec4bacc0d3133c002a00c3.web-security-academy.net/image?filename=30.jpg

i.e. i was able to go to above link

i tried the attack on this link but was getting some other error

https://0a08001204ec4bacc0d3133c002a00c3.web-security-academy.net/image?filename=../../../../../../etc/passwd

when i tried these attack and went to the original link it says i solved the lab like wtf i stil havent got the file


so instead i went for the solution now

below is the solution

1.  Use Burp Suite to intercept and modify a request that fetches a product image.
2.  Modify the `filename` parameter, giving it the value:
    
    `../../../etc/passwd`
3.  Observe that the response contains the contents of the `/etc/passwd` file.


This is exactly what i was doing but i still havent found the contents of /etc/passwd( it is not in the response)(i was only checking from browsers developer console)


i captured the same file using burpsuite nad i was able to see the /etc/passwd contents in the the packet capture


how interesting


i was able to get the contents in burp but not in browser developer network tab

<mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">i will keep this in mind or read this lab report again to remind myself to check both browser and burp</mark>
