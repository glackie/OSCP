This lab contains a [file path traversal](https://portswigger.net/web-security/file-path-traversal) vulnerability in the display of product images.

The application validates that the supplied filename ends with the expected file extension.

To solve the lab, retrieve the contents of the `/etc/passwd` file.

<mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">ANS</mark>

here i can see that extension of the iamge is getting validated at the server end

as per [[2. Local File Inclusion - LFI]]


we can use null byte to bypass this validation and this is exactly what i did

../../../etc/passwd%00 - this didnt work



Here when i read the question it said that the server is expecting the file extion to be there and lab says we can bypass it with null byte. 

so i tried the below paramater and viola, completed the lab
