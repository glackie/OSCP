## What is CSRF?

Cross-site request forgery (also known as CSRF) is a web security vulnerability that allows an attacker to induce users to perform actions that they do not intend to perform. 


It allows an attacker to partly circumvent the same origin policy, which is designed to prevent different websites from interfering with each other.

What is Same origin policy?

The **same-origin policy** is a critical security mechanism that restricts how a document or script loaded by one [origin](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Origin) can interact with a resource from another origin.

It helps isolate potentially malicious documents, reducing possible attack vectors. 

What is an Origin?

Two URLs have the _same origin_ if the [protocol](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Protocol), [port](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Port) (if specified), and [host](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Host) are the same for both. 

You may see this referenced as the "scheme/host/port tuple", or just "tuple". (A "tuple" is a set of items that together comprise a whole â€” a generic form for double/triple/quadruple/quintuple/etc.)

The following table gives examples of origin comparisons with the URL `http://store.company.com/dir/page.html`:

URL - Outcome - Reason

`http://store.company.com/dir2/other.html` - Same origin - Only the path differs

`http://store.company.com/dir/inner/another.html` - Same origin- Only the path differs

`https://store.company.com/page.html`
Failure - Different protocol

`http://store.company.com:81/dir/page.html`
Failure - Different port (`http://` is port 80 by default)

`http://news.company.com/dir/page.html`
Failure - Different host
