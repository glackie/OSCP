This lab stores user chat logs directly on the server's file system, and retrieves them using static URLs.

Solve the lab by finding the password for the user `carlos`, and logging into their account.

Here i logged in as wiener

went to the live chat page in the page source code i saw there is a path of /download-transcript

but got a 404 error 


also found this 
/resources/js/viewTranscript.js

but didnt knew what to do with it and got stuck so i went for the solution

1.  Select the **Live chat** tab.
2.  Send a message and then select **View transcript**.
3.  Review the URL and observe that the transcripts are text files assigned a filename containing an incrementing number.
4.  Change the filename to `1.txt` and review the text. Notice a password within the chat transcript.
5.  Return to the main lab page and log in using the stolen credentials.

After reading the solution i somewhat got the logic and visited the 

GET /download-transcript/1.txt



here i was able to see a transcript of someone chatting and revealing a password

used thatt to login as carlos and completed that lab
