This lab contains an [access control](https://portswigger.net/web-security/access-control) vulnerability where sensitive information is leaked in the body of a redirect response.

To solve the lab, obtain the API key for the user `carlos` and submit it as the solution.

You can log in to your own account using the following credentials: `wiener:peter`

objective here is to look in every redirect to check where the leakage is happening


now i knew HTTP response codes 300 - 399 are redirects so after i logged in i randomly spammed every corver of the website and looked for http with 300- 399 code (my plan basically)

And it worked


i went to the my-account page,
changed the paramter from wiener to carlos and the page redirected me to login page

however in the content it share the APi key of carlos
