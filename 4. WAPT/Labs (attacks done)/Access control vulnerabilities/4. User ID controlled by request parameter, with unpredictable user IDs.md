This lab has a horizontal privilege escalation vulnerability on the user account page, but identifies users with GUIDs.

To solve the lab, find the GUID for `carlos`, then submit his API key as the solution.

You can log in to your own account using the following credentials: `wiener:peter`

here i followed the same steps like previous lab but here in the URL instead of name there was an ID parameter


i thought geeting Id of carlos would solve this so i started looking for it

updated my email looked in burp for any infomration but no luck and went for the solution

1.  Find a blog post by `carlos`.
2.  Click on `carlos` and observe that the URL contains his user ID. Make a note of this ID.
3.  Log in using the supplied credentials and access your account page.
4.  Change the "id" parameter to the saved user ID.
5.  Retrieve and submit the API key.

Lesson learnt: check the entire website to see if you can find any thing. i slacked of here by onlky searching in page source code and not actually going into every blog post



i folowed the solution steps and complete the lab
