This lab contains an [OS command injection](https://portswigger.net/web-security/os-command-injection) vulnerability in the product stock checker.

The application executes a shell command containing user-supplied product and store IDs, and returns the raw output from the command in its response.

To solve the lab, execute the `whoami` command to determine the name of the current user.

Solution:

1.  Use Burp Suite to intercept and modify a request that checks the stock level.
2.  Modify the `storeID` parameter, giving it the value `1|whoami`.
3.  Observe that the response contains the name of the current user.

Followed the above instruction and solved the lab
