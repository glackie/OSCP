Bruteforce DNS (Domain Name System) enumeration is the method of trying tens, hundreds, thousands or even millions of different possible subdomains from a pre-defined list of commonly used subdomains. 

Because this method requires many requests, we automate it with tools to make the process quicker. 

In this instance, we are using a tool called dnsrecon to perform this.
