- Tools allow us to automate the reconnaissance that can identify potential privilege escalations.

- While it is always important to understand what tools are doing, they are invaluable in a time-limited setting, such as an exam.

- In this course we will mostly be using winPEAS and Seatbelt. 

---
#### PowerUp & SharpUp

- PowerUp & SharpUp are very similar tools that hunt for specific privilege escalation misconfiguration.

- PowerUp:

- SharpUp: https://github.com/GhostPack/SharpUp

- Pre-Compiled SharpUp: https://github.com/r3motecontrol/Ghostpack-CompiledBinaries/blob/master/SharpUp.exe

---
#### PowerUp

- To run PowerUp, start a PowerShell session and use dot
sourcing to load the script:

```
PS> . .\PowerUp.ps1
Run the Invoke-AllChecks function to start checking for
common privilege escalation misconfigurations.
PS> Invoke-AllChecks
```

---
#### SharpUp

- To run SharpUp, start a command prompt and run the
executable:
```
> .\SharpUp.exe
```

- SharpUp should immediately start checking for the same misconfigurations as PowerUp.

---

#### Seatbelt

- Seatbelt is an enumeration tool. It contains a number of enumeration checks.

- It does not actively hunt for privilege escalation misconfigurations, but provides related information for further investigation.

Code: https://github.com/GhostPack/Seatbelt
Pre-Compiled: https://github.com/r3motecontrol/Ghostpack-CompiledBinaries/blob/master/Seatbelt.exe

---
#### Seatbelt

- To run all checks and filter out unimportant results:
```
> .\Seatbelt.exe all
```
- To run specific check(s):
```
> .\Seatbelt.exe <check> <check> ...
```

---
#### WinPEAS

- winPEAS is a very powerful tool that not only actively
hunts for privilege escalation misconfigurations, but
highlights them for the user in the results.

https://github.com/carlospolop/privilege-escalation-awesome-scripts-suite/tree/master/winPEAS

- Before running, we need to add a registry key and then reopen the command prompt:
```
> reg add HKCU\Console /v VirtualTerminalLevel
/t REG_DWORD /d 1
```

- Run all checks while avoiding time-consuming searches:
```
> .\winPEASany.exe quiet cmd fast
```
- Run specific check categories:
```
> .\winPEASany.exe quiet cmd systeminfo
```
