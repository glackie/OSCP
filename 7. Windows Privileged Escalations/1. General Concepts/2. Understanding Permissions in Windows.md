<mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;">UserAccounts</mark>

User accounts are used to log into a Windows system.

Think of a user account as a collection of settings / preferences bound to a unique identity.

The local “Administrator” account is created by default at installation.

Several other default user accounts may exist (e.g. Guest) depending on the version of Windows.


<mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;">Service Accounts</mark>


Service accounts are (somewhat obviously) used to run services in Windows.

Service accounts cannot be used to sign into a Windows system.

The SYSTEM account is a default service account which has the highest privileges of any local account in Windows.

Other default service accounts include NETWORK SERVICE and LOCAL SERVICE.


<mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;">Groups</mark>

User accounts can belong to multiple groups, and groups can have multiple users.

Groups allow for easier access control to resources.

Regular groups (e.g. Administrators, Users) have a set list of members.
Pseudo groups (e.g. “Authenticated Users”) have a dynamic list of members which changes based on certain interactions.


<mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;">Resources</mark>

In Windows, there are multiple types of resource (also known as objects):
• Files / Directories
• Registry Entries
• Services

Whether a user and/or group has permission to perform a certain action on a resource depends on that resource’s access control list (ACL).


<mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;">ACLs & ACEs</mark>

Permissions to access a certain resource in Windows are controlled by the access control list (ACL) for that resource.

Each ACL is made up of zero or more access control entries (ACEs).

Each ACE defines the relationship between a principal (e.g. a user, group) and a certain access right.
