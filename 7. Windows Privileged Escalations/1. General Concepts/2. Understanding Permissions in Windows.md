#### UserAccounts

- User accounts are used to log into a Windows system.

- Think of a user account as a collection of settings / preferences bound to a unique identity.

- The local “Administrator” account is created by default at installation.

- Several other default user accounts may exist (e.g. Guest) depending on the version of Windows.

---
#### Service Accounts


- Service accounts are (somewhat obviously) used to run services in Windows.

- Service accounts cannot be used to sign into a Windows system.

- The SYSTEM account is a default service account which has the highest privileges of any local account in Windows.

- Other default service accounts include NETWORK SERVICE and LOCAL SERVICE.

---
#### Groups

- User accounts can belong to multiple groups, and groups can have multiple users.

- Groups allow for easier access control to resources.

- Regular groups (e.g. Administrators, Users) have a set list of members.

- Pseudo groups (e.g. “Authenticated Users”) have a dynamic list of members which changes based on certain interactions.

#### Resources

- In Windows, there are multiple types of resource (also known as objects):
• Files / Directories
• Registry Entries
• Services

- Whether a user and/or group has permission to perform a certain action on a resource depends on that resource’s access control list (ACL).

---
#### ACLs & ACEs

- Permissions to access a certain resource in Windows are controlled by the access control list (ACL) for that resource.

- Each ACL is made up of zero or more access control entries (ACEs).

- Each ACE defines the relationship between a principal (e.g. a user, group) and a certain access right.
