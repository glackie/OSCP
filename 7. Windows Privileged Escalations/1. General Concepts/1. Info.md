Our ultimate goal with privilege escalation in Windows is to gain a shell running as an Administrator or the SYSTEM user.

Privilege escalation can be simple (e.g. a kernel exploit) or require a lot of reconnaissance on the compromised system.



In a lot of cases, privilege escalation may not simply rely on a single misconfiguration, but may require you to think, and combine multiple misconfigurations.

All privilege escalations are effectively examples of access control violations.

Access control and user permissions are intrinsically linked.


When focusing on privilege escalations in Windows,
understanding how Windows handles permissions is very important.
