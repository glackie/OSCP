- We can use RDP command to transfer files using `xfreerdp`

```
xfreerdp /v:10.10.25.75 /u:USERNAME /p:PASSWORD /cert:ignore +clipboard /dynamic-resolution /drive:share,/tmp
```

There's a bunch of stuff going on here, so let's break each switch down:

- `/cert:ignore` -- RDP connections are encrypted. If our attacking machine doesn't recognise the certificate presented by the machine we are connecting to it will warn us and ask if we wish to proceed; this switch simply ignores that warning automatically.
- `+clipboard` -- this shares our clipboard with the target, allowing us to copy and paste between our attacking machine and the target machine.
- `/dynamic-resolution` lets us resize the GUI window, adjusting the resolution of our remote session automatically.
- `/drive:share,/tmp` -- our final switch, this shares our own `/tmp` directory with the target. This is an _extremely_ useful trick as it allows us to execute scripts and programs from our own machine without actually transferring them to the target (we will see this in action later!)
