Unfortunately, there is no easy method for enumerating custom tasks that belong to
other users as a low privileged user account.


List all scheduled tasks your user can see:
> schtasks /query /fo LIST /v


In PowerShell:
PS> Get-ScheduledTask | where {$_.TaskPath -notlike
"\Microsoft*"} | ft TaskName,TaskPath,State


Often we have to rely on other clues, such as finding a script or log file that indicates a scheduled task is being run.
