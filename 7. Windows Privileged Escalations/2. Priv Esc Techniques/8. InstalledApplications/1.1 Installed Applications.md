Most privilege escalations relating to installed
applications are based on misconfigurations we have
already covered.

Still, some privilege escalations results from things like
buffer overflows, so knowing how to identify installed
applications and known vulnerabilities is still important.

Commands

Manually enumerate all running programs:
> tasklist /v


We can also use Seatbelt to search for nonstandard
processes:
> .\seatbelt.exe NonstandardProcesses


winPEAS also has this ability (note the misspelling):
> .\winPEASany.exe quiet procesinfo



Exploit-DB


Once you find an interesting process, try to identify its
version. 

You can try running the executable with /? or -h, as well as checking config or text files in the Program Files directory.


Use Exploit-DB to search for a corresponding exploit.
Some exploits contain instructions, while others are code that you will need to compile and run.
