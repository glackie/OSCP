Often a service will try to load functionality from a library called a DLL (dynamic-link library). 

Whatever functionality the
DLL provides, will be executed with the same privileges as the service that loaded it.

If a DLL is loaded with an absolute path, it might be possible to escalate privileges if that DLL is writable by our user.


A more common misconfiguration that can be used to
escalate privileges is if a DLL is missing from the system, and our user has write access to a directory within the PATH that Windows searches for DLLs in.


Unfortunately, initial detection of vulnerable services is difficult, and often the entire process is very manual.
