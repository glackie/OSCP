Executables in Windows can be run without using their
extension (e.g. “whoami.exe” can be run by just typing
“whoami”).

Some executables take arguments, separated by spaces, e.g. `someprog.exe arg1 arg2 arg3...`

This behavior leads to ambiguity when using absolute paths that are unquoted and contain spaces.

Consider the following unquoted path:

```
C:\Program Files\Some Dir\SomeProgram.exe
```


To us, this obviously runs SomeProgram.exe. 

To Windows, `C:\Program` could be
the executable, with two arguments: `“Files\Some”` and `“Dir\ SomeProgram.exe”`


Windows resolves this ambiguity by checking each of the possibilities in turn.

If we can write to a location Windows checks before the actual executable, we can trick the service into executing it instead.
