Windows stores password hashes in the 
Security Account Manager (SAM).

The hashes are encrypted with a key which can be found in a file named SYSTEM.

If you have the ability to read the SAM and SYSTEM files, you can extract the hashes.

The SAM and SYSTEM files are located in the
C:\Windows\System32\config directory.


The files are locked while Windows is running.

Backups of the files may exist in the 
C:\Windows\Repair
or 
C:\Windows\System32\config\RegBack directories.
