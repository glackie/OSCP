Windows has a runas command which allows users to run commands with the privileges of other users.

This usually requires the knowledge of the other userâ€™s
password.

However, Windows also allows users to save their credentials to the system, and these saved credentials can be used to bypass this requirement.


>Note: We will not be able to see the credentials itself but will only be able to if there are any or not
