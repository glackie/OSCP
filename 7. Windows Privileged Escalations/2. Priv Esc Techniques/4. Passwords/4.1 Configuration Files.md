Some administrators will leave configurations files on
the system with passwords in them.

The Unattend.xml file is an example of this.

It allows for the largely automated setup of Windows
systems.

Recursively search for files in the current directory with “pass” in the name, or ending in “.config”:
> dir /s *pass* == *.config


Recursively search for files in the current directory that contain the word “password” and also end in either .xml, .ini, or .txt:

> findstr /si password *.xml *.ini *.txt
