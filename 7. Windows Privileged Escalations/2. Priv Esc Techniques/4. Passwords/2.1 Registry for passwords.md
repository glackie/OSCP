Plenty of programs store configuration options in the
Windows Registry.

Windows itself sometimes will store passwords in
plaintext in the Registry.

It is always worth searching the Registry for passwords.



The following commands will search the registry for keys and values that contain “password”

> reg query HKLM /f password /t REG_SZ /s


> reg query HKCU /f password /t REG_SZ /s


This usually generates a lot of results, so often it is more fruitful to look in known locations.
