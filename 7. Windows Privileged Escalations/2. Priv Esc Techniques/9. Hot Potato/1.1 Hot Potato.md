Hot Potato is the name of an attack that uses a spoofing attack along with an NTLM relay attack to gain SYSTEM privileges.


The attack tricks Windows into authenticating as the SYSTEM user to a fake HTTP server using NTLM. 

The NTLM credentials then get relayed to SMB in order to gain command execution.

This attack works on Windows 7, 8, early versions of Windows 10, and their server counterparts.
