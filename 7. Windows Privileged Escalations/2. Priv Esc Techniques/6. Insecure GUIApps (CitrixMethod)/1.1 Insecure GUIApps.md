On some (older) versions of Windows, users could be granted the permission to run certain GUI apps with administrator privileges.

There are often numerous ways to spawn command prompts from within GUI apps, including using native Windows functionality.

Since the parent process is running with administrator privileges, the spawned command prompt will also run with these privileges.

I call this the “Citrix Method” because it uses many of the same techniques used to break out of Citrix environments.
