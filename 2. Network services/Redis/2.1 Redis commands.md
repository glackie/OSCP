## Run Commands on the Remote Server

To run commands on Redis remote server, you need to connect to the server by the same client **redis-cli**

### Syntax

```
$ redis-cli -h host -p port -a password
```


Useful commands

```
redis-cli --help
```

```
redis-cli info
```


- If a password and username have been set for the server, you can provide them with the `-u` flag for username and `-a` for password. 

- Using these flags is not recommended as anyone who [retrieves your bash history](https://spectralops.io/blog/the-beginners-guide-to-preventing-data-breaches-in-your-code/) will be able to see your password, so itâ€™s usually better to use the `AUTH` command in interactive mode.

```java
$ redis-cli
AUTH <username> <password>
```

- **A Redis server has 16 databases by default**. The databases are zero-indexed, with the first database being `0`.

- You can check the actual number by running `redis-cli config get databases.`
