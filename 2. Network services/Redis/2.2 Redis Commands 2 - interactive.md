- we can list the keys in redis using
```
10.10.146.124:6379> KEYS *

```


- we can get the value of a key using
```
10.10.146.124:6379> GET "internal flag"
```


- now in a machine i got an error of 

```
10.10.146.124:6379> GET "marketlist"

```

understood that

Redis supports 6 data types. You need to know what type of value that a key maps to, as for each data type, the command to retrieve it is different.

Here are the commands to retrieve key value(s):

- if value is of type string -> GET `<key>`
- if value is of type hash -> HGET or HMGET or HGETALL `<key>`
- if value is of type lists -> lrange `<key> <start> <end>`
- if value is of type sets -> smembers `<key>`
- if value is of type sorted sets -> ZRANGEBYSCORE `<key> <min> <max>`
- if value is of type stream -> xread count `<count>` streams `<key>` `<ID>`. [https://redis.io/commands/xread](https://redis.io/commands/xread)

Use the [`TYPE`](https://redis.io/commands/type) command to check the type of value a key is mapping to:

- type `<key>`
