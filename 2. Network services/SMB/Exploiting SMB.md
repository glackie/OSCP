While there are vulnerabilities such as [CVE-2017-7494](https://www.cvedetails.com/cve/CVE-2017-7494/) that can allow remote code execution by exploiting SMB,
you're more likely to encounter a situation where the best way into a system is due to misconfigurations in the system.

In this case, we're going to be exploiting anonymous SMB share access- a common misconfiguration that can allow us to gain information that will lead to a shell.

<mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">**SMBClient**</mark>


Because we're trying to access an SMB share, we need a client to access resources on servers. We will be using SMBClient because it's part of the default samba suite.

We can remotely access the SMB share using the syntax:

`smbclient \\[IP]\[SHARE]`

Followed by the tags:

-U [name] : to specify the user

-p [port] : to specify the port


  
Lets see if our interesting share has been configured to allow anonymous access, I.E it doesn't require authentication to view the files. We can do this easily by:

	smbclient //10.10.163.192/profiles -U anonymous

	press enter for password

now you may have an smb shell

	l to list down files

	get "<enter file name here>"
