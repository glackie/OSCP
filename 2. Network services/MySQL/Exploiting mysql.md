**What do we know?**1


1.  MySQL server credentials  

2. The version of MySQL running

3. The number of Databases, and their names.

**Schema:**

> In MySQL, physically, a _schema_ is synonymous with a _database_. You can substitute the keyword "SCHEMA" instead of DATABASE in MySQL SQL syntax, for example using CREATE SCHEMA instead of CREATE DATABASE. It's important to understand this relationship because some other database products draw a distinction. For example, in the Oracle Database product, a _schema_ represents only a part of a database: the tables and other objects owned by a single user.


use the module 

1. auxiliary/scanner/mysql/mysql_schemadump

2. auxiliary/scanner/mysql/mysql_hashdump

and get all required data

>john hashfile.txt 

	Note: hash file format for this example was
	carl:*EA031893AA21444B170FC2162A56978B8CEECE18

now when we crack the password we use this to login via SSH and get the flag
