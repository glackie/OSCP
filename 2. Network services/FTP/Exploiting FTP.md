So, from our enumeration stage, we know:

    - There is an FTP server running on this machine  

    - We have a possible username  

Using this information, let's try and **bruteforce** the password of the FTP Server.


we can use tools such as

hashcat, hydra, metasploit to bruteforce FTP login and get the user credentials

exaple for hydra bruteforce

**hydra -t 4 -l dale -P /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt -vV 10.10.10.6 ftp"**
