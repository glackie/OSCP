OP, or "Post Office Protocol" and IMAP, "Internet Message Access Protocol" are both email protocols who are responsible for the transfer of email between a client and a mail server. 

The main differences is in POP's more simplistic approach of downloading the inbox from the mail server, to the client. 

Where IMAP will synchronise the current inbox, with new mail on the server, downloading anything new. 

This means that changes to the inbox made on one computer, over IMAP, will persist if you then synchronise the inbox from another computer. 

The POP/IMAP server is responsible for fulfiling this process.
