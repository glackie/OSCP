NFS stands for "Network File System" and allows a system to share directories and files with others over a network. 

By using NFS, users and programs can access files on remote systems almost as if they were local files.

It does this by mounting all, or a portion of a file system on a server. The portion of the file system that is mounted can be accessed by clients with whatever privileges are assigned to each file.
