if you have a low privilege shell on any machine and you found that a machine has an NFS share you might be able to use that to escalate privileges, depending on how it is configured.


**What is root_squash?**

	By default, on NFS shares- Root Squashing is enabled, and prevents anyone connecting to the NFS share from having root access to the NFS volume. 
	Remote root users are assigned a user “nfsnobody” when connected, which has the least local privileges. Not what we want.
	 However, if this is turned off, it can allow the creation of SUID bit files, allowing a remote user root access to the connected system.

**SUID**

	SUID or Set Owner User ID is a permission bit flag that applies to executables. SUID allows an alternate user to run an executable with the same permissions as the owner of the file instead of the permissions of the alternate user.
	

How to set SUID permissions to a file

	chmod +s <filename>
	chmod 4700 <executable>
	

**Method

This sounds complicated, but really- provided you're familiar with how SUID files work, it's fairly easy to understand. We're able to upload files to the NFS share, and control the permissions of these files. We can set the permissions of whatever we upload, in this case a bash shell executable. We can then log in through SSH, as we did in the previous task- and execute this executable to gain a root shell!

**Mapped Out Pathway:**

If this is still hard to follow, here's a step by step of the actions we're taking, and how they all tie together to allow us to gain a root shell:

    1. NFS Access ->

        2. Gain Low Privilege Shell ->

            3. Upload Bash Executable to the NFS share ->

                4. Set SUID Permissions Through NFS Due To Misconfigured Root Squash ->

                    5. Login through SSH ->

                        6. Execute SUID Bit Bash Executable ->

                            7. ROOT ACCESS
